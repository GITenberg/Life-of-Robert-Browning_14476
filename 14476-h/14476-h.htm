<p>In all important respects I leave this volume to speak for itself. For
obvious reasons it does not pretend to be more than a <i>M&eacute;moire pour
servir</i>: in the nature of things, the definitive biography cannot
appear for many years to come. None the less gratefully may I take the
present opportunity to express my indebtedness to Mr. R. Barrett
Browning, and to other relatives and intimate friends of Robert Browning,
who have given me serviceable information, and otherwise rendered kindly
aid. For some of the hitherto unpublished details my thanks are, in
particular, due to Mrs. Fraser Corkran and Miss Alice Corkran, and to
other old friends of the poet and his family, here, in Italy, and in
America; though in one or two instances, I may add, I had them from Robert
Browning himself. It is with pleasure that I further acknowledge my
indebtedness to Dr. Furnivall, for the loan of the advance-proofs of his
privately-printed pamphlet on "Browning's Ancestors"; and to the
Browning Society's Publications--particularly to Mrs. Sutherland Orr's
and Dr. Furnivall's biographical and bibliographical contributions
thereto; to Mr. Gosse's biographical article in the <i>Century Magazine</i>
<a name="page10" id="page10">for</a> 1881; to Mr. Ingram's
<i>Life of E.B. Browning</i>; and to the <i>Memoirs of Anna Jameson</i>,
the <i>Italian Note-Books</i> of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mr.
G.S. Hillard's <i>Six Months in Italy</i> (1853), and the Lives and
Correspondence of Macready, Miss Mitford, Leigh Hunt, and Walter Savage
Landor. I regret that the imperative need of concision has prevented the
insertion of many of the letters, anecdotes, and reminiscences, so
generously placed at my disposal; but possibly I may have succeeded in
educing from them some essential part of that light which they
undoubtedly cast upon the personality and genius of the poet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>It must, to admirers of Browning's writings, appear singularly
appropriate that so cosmopolitan a poet was born in London. It would
seem as though something of that mighty complex life, so confusedly
petty to the narrow vision, so grandiose and even majestic to the larger
ken, had blent with his being from the first. What fitter birthplace for
the poet whom a comrade has called the "Subtlest Assertor of the Soul in
Song," the poet whose writings are indeed a mirror of the age?</p>

<p>A man may be in all things a Londoner and yet be a provincial. The
accident of birthplace does not necessarily involve parochialism of the
soul. It is not the village which produces the Hampden, but the Hampden
who immortalises the village. It is a favourite jest of Rusticus that
his urban brother has the manner of Omniscience and the knowledge of a
parish beadle. Nevertheless, though the strongest blood insurgent in the
metropolitan heart is not that which is native to it,
<a name="page12" id="page12">one</a> might well be proud to have had one's
atom-pulse atune from the first with the large rhythm of the national
life at its turbulent, congested, but ever ebullient centre. Certainly
Browning was not the man to be ashamed of his being a Londoner, much less
to deny his natal place. He was proud of it: through good sense, no doubt,
but possibly also through some instinctive apprehension of the fact that
the great city was indeed the fit mother of such a son. "Ashamed of
having been born in the greatest city of the world!" he exclaimed on
one occasion; "what an extraordinary thing to say! It suggests a wavelet
in a muddy shallow grimily contorting itself because it had its birth
out in the great ocean."</p>

<p>On the day of the poet's funeral in Westminster Abbey, one of the most
eminent of his peers remarked to me that Browning came to us as one
coming into his own. This is profoundly true. There was in good sooth a
mansion prepared against his advent. Long ago, we should have
surrendered as to a conqueror: now, however, we know that princes of the
mind, though they must be valorous and potent as of yore, can enter upon
no heritance save that which naturally awaits them, and has been made
theirs by long and intricate processes.</p>

<p>The lustrum which saw the birth of Robert Browning, that is the third in
the nineteenth century, was a remarkable one indeed. Thackeray came into
the world some months earlier than the great poet, Charles Dickens
within the same twelvemonth, and Tennyson three years sooner, when also
Elizabeth Barrett was born, and the foremost naturalist of modern times
first saw the light. <a name="page13" id="page13">It</a> is a matter of
significance that the great wave of scientific thought which ultimately
bore forward on its crest so many famous men, from Brewster and Faraday
to Charles Darwin, had just begun to rise with irresistible impulsion.
Lepsius's birth was in 1813, and that of the great Flemish novelist,
Henri Conscience, in 1812: about the same period were the births of
Freiligrath, Gutzkow, and Auerbach, respectively one of the most lyrical
poets, the most potent dramatist, the most charming romancer of Germany:
and, also, in France, of Th&eacute;ophile Gautier and Alfred de Musset. Among
representatives of the other arts--with two of which Browning must ever
be closely associated--Mendelssohn and Chopin were born in 1809, and Schumann,
Liszt, and Wagner within the four succeeding years: within which space
also came Diaz and Meissonier and the great Millet. Other high names
there are upon the front of the century. Macaulay, Cardinal Newman, John
Stuart Mill (one of the earliest, by the way, to recognise the genius of
Browning), Alexandre Dumas, George Sand, Victor Hugo, Amp&egrave;re, Quinet,
Prosper Merim&eacute;e, Sainte-Beuve, Strauss, Montalembert, are among the
laurel-bearers who came into existence betwixt 1800 and 1812.</p>

<p>When Robert Browning was born in London in 1812, Sheridan had still four
years to live; Jeremy Bentham was at the height of his contemporary
reputation, and Godwin was writing glibly of the virtues of humanity and
practising the opposite qualities, while Crabbe was looked upon as one
of the foremost of living poets. Wordsworth was then forty, Sir Walter
Scott forty-one, Coleridge forty-two, Walter Savage Landor and Charles
Lamb each in his forty-fifth year. Byron <a name="page14" id="page14">was</a>
four-and-twenty, Shelley not yet quite of age, two radically different men,
Keats and Carlyle, both youths of seventeen. Abroad, Laplace was in his
maturity, with fifteen years more yet to live; Joubert with twelve; Goethe,
with twenty; Lamarck, the Schlegels, Cuvier, Chateaubriand, Hegel, Nieb&uuml;hr
(to specify some leading names only), had many years of work before
them. Schopenhauer was only four-and-twenty, while B&eacute;ranger was
thirty-two. The Polish poet Mickiewicz was a boy of fourteen, and
Poushkin was but a twelvemonth older; Heine, a lad of twelve, was
already enamoured of the great Napoleonic legend. The foremost literary
critic of the century was running about the sands of Boulogne, or
perhaps wandering often along the ramparts of the old town,
introspective even then, with something of that rare and insatiable
curiosity which we all now recognise as so distinctive of Sainte-Beuve.
Again, the greatest creative literary artist of the century, in prose at
any rate, was leading an apparently somewhat indolent schoolboy life at
Tours, undreamful yet of enormous debts, colossal undertakings, gigantic
failures, and the <i>Com&eacute;die Humaine.</i> In art, Sir Henry Raeburn, William
Blake, Flaxman, Canova, Thorwaldsen, Crome, Sir Thomas Lawrence,
Constable, Sir David Wilkie, and Turner were in the exercise of their
happiest faculties: as were, in the usage of theirs, Beethoven, Weber,
Schubert, Spohr, Donizetti, and Bellini.</p>

<p>It is not inadvisedly that I make this specification of great names, of
men who were born coincidentally with, or were in the broader sense
contemporaries of Robert Browning. There is no such thing as a
fortuitous birth. Creation does not occur spontaneously, as in that
drawing <a name="page15" id="page15">of</a> David Scott's where from the
footprint of the Omnipotent spring human spirits and fiery stars. Literally
indeed, as a great French writer has indicated, a man is the child of his
time. It is a matter often commented upon by students of literature, that
great men do not appear at the beginning, but rather at the acme of a period.
They are not the flying scud of the coming wave, but the gleaming crown of
that wave itself. The epoch expends itself in preparation for these
great ones.</p>

<p>If Nature's first law were not a law of excess, the economy of life
would have meagre results. I think it is Turgenïev who speaks somewhere
of her as a gigantic Titan, working in gloomy silence, with the same
savage intentness upon a subtler twist of a flea's joints as upon the
Destinies of Man.</p>

<p>If there be a more foolish cry than that poetry is on the wane, it is
that the great days had passed away even before Robert Browning and
Alfred Tennyson were born. The way was prepared for Browning, as it was
for Shakspere: as it is, beyond doubt, for the next high peer of these.</p>

<p>There were 'Roberts' among the sons of the Browning family for at least
four generations. It has been affirmed, on disputable authority, that
the surname is the English equivalent for Bruning, and that the family
is of Teutonic origin. Possibly: but this origin is too remote to be of
any practical concern. Browning himself, it may be added, told Mr.
Moncure Conway that the original name was De Bruni. It is not a matter
of much importance: the poet was, personally and to a great extent in
his genius, Anglo-Saxon. Though there are <a name="page16" id="page16">plausible</a>
grounds for the assumption. I can find nothing to substantiate the common
assertion that, immediately, or remotely, his people were Jews.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref1" id="fnref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn1" id="fn1" href="#fnref1">[1]</a></span>
Fairly conclusive evidence to the contrary, on the paternal
side, is afforded in the fact that, in 1757, the poet's
great-grandfather gave one of his sons the baptismal name of Christian.
Dr. Furnivall's latest researches prove that there is absolutely "no
ground for supposing the presence of any Jewish blood in the poet's

<p>As to Browning's physiognomy and personal traits, this much may be
granted: if those who knew him were told he was a Jew they would not be
much surprised. In his exuberant vitality, in his sensuous love of music
and the other arts, in his combined imaginativeness and shrewdness of
common sense, in his superficial expansiveness and actual reticence, he
would have been typical enough of the potent and artistic race for whom
he has so often of late been claimed.</p>

<p>What, however, is most to the point is that neither to curious
acquaintances nor to intimate friends, neither to Jews nor Gentiles, did
he ever admit more than that he was a good Protestant, and sprung of a
Puritan stock. He was tolerant of all religious forms, but with a
natural bias towards Anglican Evangelicalism.</p>

<p>In appearance there was, perhaps, something of the Semite in Robert
Browning: yet this is observable but slightly in the portraits of him
during the last twenty years, and scarcely at all in those which
represent him as a young man. It is most marked in the drawing by Rudolf
Lehmann, representing Browning at the age of forty-seven, where he looks
out upon us with a physiognomy which is, at least, as much distinctively
Jewish as English. <a name="page17" id="page17">Possibly</a> the large
dark eyes (so unlike both in colour and shape what they were in later
life) and curved nose and full lips, with the oval face, may have been,
as it were, seen judaically by the artist. These characteristics, again,
are greatly modified in Mr. Lehmann's subsequent portrait in oils.</p>

<p>The poet's paternal great-grandfather, who was owner of the Woodyates
Inn, in the parish of Pentridge, in Dorsetshire, claimed to come of good
west-country stock. Browning believed, but always conscientiously
maintained there was no proof in support of the assumption, that he was
a descendant of the Captain Micaiah Browning who, as Macaulay relates in
his <i>History of England</i>, raised the siege of Derry in 1689 by springing
the boom across Lough Foyle, and perished in the act. The same ancestral
line is said to comprise the Captain Browning who commanded the ship
<i>The Holy Ghost</i>, which conveyed Henry V. to France before he fought the
Battle of Agincourt, and in recognition of whose services two waves,
said to represent waves of the sea, were added to his coat of arms. It
is certainly a point of some importance in the evidence, as has been
indicated, that these arms were displayed by the gallant Captain
Micaiah, and are borne by the present family. That the poet was a
pure-bred Englishman in the strictest sense, however, as has commonly
been asserted, is not the case. His mother was Scottish, through her
mother and by birth, but her father was the son of a German from
Hamburg, named Wiedemann, who, by the way, in connection with his
relationship as maternal grandfather to the poet, it is interesting to
note, was an accomplished draughtsman <a name="page18" id="page18">and</a>
musician.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref2" id="fnref2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></span>
Browning's paternal grandmother, again, was a Creole. As Mrs. Orr remarks,
this pedigree throws a valuable light on the vigour and variety of the poet's
genius. Possibly the main current of his ancestry is as little strictly
English as German. A friend sends me the following paragraph from a
Scottish paper:--"What of the Scottish Brownings? I had it long ago from
one of the name that the Brownings came originally from Ayrshire, and
that several families of them emigrated to the North of Ireland during
the times of the Covenanters. There is, moreover, a small town or
village in the North of Ireland called Browningstown. Might not the poet
be related to these Scottish Brownings?"</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn2" id="fn2" href="#fnref2">[2]</a></span>
It has frequently been stated that Browning's maternal grandfather,
Mr. Wiedemann, was a Jew. Mr. Wiedemann, the son of a Hamburg merchant,
was a small shipowner in Dundee. Had he, or his father, been Semitic,
he would not have baptised one of his daughters 'Christiana.'
</div>

<p>Browning's great-grandfather, as indicated above, was a small proprietor
in Dorsetshire. His son, whether perforce or from choice, removed to
London when he was a youth, and speedily obtained a clerkship in the
Bank of England, where he remained for fifty years, till he was
pensioned off in 1821 with over £400 a year. He died in 1833. His wife,
to whom he was married in or about 1780, was one Margaret Morris Tittle,
a Creole, born in the West Indies. Her portrait, by Wright of Derby,
used to hang in the poet's dining-room. They resided, Mr. R. Barrett
Browning tells me, in Battersea, where his grandfather was their
first-born. The paternal grandfather of the poet decided that his three
sons, Robert, William Shergold, and Reuben, should go into business,
<a name="page19" id="page19">the</a> two younger in London, the elder abroad.
All three became efficient financial clerks, and attained to good positions
and fair means.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref3" id="fnref3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></span>
The eldest, Robert, was a man of exceptional powers. He was a poet, both in
sentiment and expression; and he understood, as well as enjoyed, the
excellent in art. He was a scholar, too, in a reputable fashion: not
indifferent to what he had learnt in his youth, nor heedless of the high
opinion generally entertained for the greatest writers of antiquity, but
with a particular care himself for Horace and Anacreon. As his son once
told a friend. "The old gentleman's brain was a storehouse of literary
and philosophical antiquities. He was completely versed in medi&aelig;val
legend, and seemed to have known Paracelsus, Faustus, and even Talmudic
personages, personally"--a significant detail, by the way. He was fond
of metrical composition, and his ease and grace in the use of the heroic
couplet were the admiration, not only of his intellectual associates,
but, in later days, of his son, who was wont to affirm, certainly in all
seriousness, that expressionally his father was a finer poetic artist
than himself. Some one has recorded of him that he was an authority on
the Letters of Junius: fortunately he had more tangible claims than this
to the esteem of his fellows. It was his boast that, notwithstanding the
exigencies of his vocation, he knew as much of the history of art as any
professional critic. His extreme modesty is deducible from this na&iuml;ve
remark. He was an amateur <a name="page20" id="page20">artist</a>, moreover,
as well as poet, critic, and student. I have seen several of his drawings
which are praise-worthy: his studies in portraiture, particularly, are ably
touched: and, as is well known, he had an active faculty of pictorial
caricature. In the intervals of leisure which beset the best regulated
clerk he was addicted to making drawings of the habitual visitors to the
Bank of England, in which he had obtained a post on his return, in 1803,
from the West Indies, and in the enjoyment of which he remained till
1853, when he retired on a small pension. His son had an independent
income, but whether from a bequest, or in the form of an allowance from
his then unmarried Uncle Reuben, is uncertain. In the first year of his
marriage Mr. Browning resided in an old house in Southampton Street,
Peckham, and there the poet was born. The house was long ago pulled
down, and another built on its site. Mr. Browning afterwards removed to
another domicile in the same Peckham district. Many years later, he and
his family left Camberwell and resided at Hatcham, near New Cross, where
his brothers and sisters (by his father's second marriage) lived. There
was a stable attached to the Hatcham house, and in it Mr. Reuben
Browning kept his horse, which he let his poet-nephew ride, while he
himself was at his desk in Rothschild's bank. No doubt this horse was
the 'York' alluded to by the poet in the letter quoted, as a footnote,
at page 189 of this book. Some years after his wife's death, which
occurred in 1849, Mr. Browning left Hatcham and came to Paddington, but
finally went to reside in Paris, and lived there, in a small street off
the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, till his death in 1866. The Creole strain seems to
have been distinctly <a name="page21" id="page21">noticeable</a> in Mr.
Browning, so much so that it is possible it had something to do with
his unwillingness to remain at St. Kitts, where he was certainly on
one occasion treated cavalierly enough. The poet's complexion in youth,
light and ivory-toned as it was in later life, has been described as
olive, and it is said that one of his nephews, who met him in Paris
in his early manhood, took him for an Italian. It has been affirmed
that it was the emotional Creole strain in Browning which found
expression in his passion for music.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn3" id="fn3" href="#fnref3">[3]</a></span>
The three brothers were men of liberal education and literary tastes.
Mr. W.S. Browning, who died in 1874, was an author of some repute.
His <i>History of the Huguenots</i> is a standard book on the subject.
</div>

<p>By old friends of the family I have been told that Mr. Browning had a
strong liking for children, with whom his really remarkable faculty of
impromptu fiction made him a particular favourite. Sometimes he would
supplement his tales by illustrations with pencil or brush. Miss Alice
Corkran has shown me an illustrated coloured map, depictive of the main
incidents and scenery of the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, which he genially
made for "the children."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref4" id="fnref4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></span></p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn4" id="fn4" href="#fnref4">[4]</a></span>
Mrs. Fraser Corkran, who saw much of the poet's father during his
residence in Paris, has spoken to me of his extraordinary
analytical faculty in the elucidation of complex criminal cases. It was
once said of him that his detective faculty amounted to genius. This is
a significant trait in the father of the author of "The Ring and the
Book."
</div>

<p>He had three children himself--Robert, born May 7th, 1812, a daughter
named Sarianna, after her mother, and Clara. His wife was a woman of
singular beauty of nature, with a depth of religious feeling saved from
narrowness of scope only by a rare serenity and a fathomless charity.
Her son's loving admiration of her was almost a passion: even late in
life he rarely <a name="page22" id="page22">spoke</a> of her without
tears coming to his eyes. She was, moreover, of an intellectual bent
of mind, and with an artistic bias having its readiest fulfilment in
music, and, to some extent, in poetry. In the latter she inclined to
the Romanticists: her husband always maintained the supremacy of Pope.
He looked with much dubiety upon his son's early writings, "Pauline"
and "Paracelsus"; "Sordello," though he found it beyond either his
artistic or his mental apprehension, he forgave, because it was
written in rhymed couplets; the maturer works he regarded with
sympathy and pride, with a vague admiration which passed into a
clearer understanding only when his long life was drawing near
its close.</p>

<p>Of his children's company he never tired, even when they were scarce out
of babyhood. He was fond of taking the little Robert in his arms, and
walking to and fro with him in the dusk in "the library," soothing the
child to sleep by singing to him snatches of Anacreon in the original,
to a favourite old tune of his, "A Cottage in a Wood." Readers of
"Asolando" will remember the allusions in that volume to "my father who
was a scholar and knew Greek." A week or two before his death Browning
told an American friend, Mrs. Corson, in reply to a statement of hers
that no one could accuse him of letting his talents lie idle: "It would
have been quite unpardonable in my case not to have done my best. My
dear father put me in a condition most favourable for the best work I
was capable of. When I think of the many authors who have had to fight
their way through all sorts of difficulties, I have no reason to be
proud of my achievements. My good father sacrificed a fortune to his
convictions. He could not bear with <a name="page23" id="page23">slavery</a>,
and left India and accepted a humble bank-office in London. He secured
for me all the ease and comfort that a literary man needs to do good work.
It would have been shameful if I had not done my best to realise his
expectations of me."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref5" id="fnref5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></span></p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn5" id="fn5" href="#fnref5">[5]</a></span>
'India' is a slip on the part either of Browning or of Mrs.
Corson. The poet's father was never in India. He was quite a youth when
he went to his mother's sugar-plantation at St. Kitts, in the West
Indies.
</div>

<p>The home of Mr. Browning was, as already stated, in Camberwell, a suburb
then of less easy access than now, and where there were green trees, and
groves, and enticing rural perspectives into "real" country, yet withal
not without some suggestion of the metropolitan air.</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p><span class="in12">"The old trees</span><br />
     Which grew by our youth's home--the waving mass<br />
     Of climbing plants, heavy with bloom and dew--<br />
     The morning swallows with their songs like words--<br />
     All these seem clear. . . .<br />
    <span class="in11">. . . most distinct amid</span><br />
     The fever and the stir of after years."</p>
    <p class="right">(<i>Pauline</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p>Another great writer of our time was born in the same parish: and those
who would know Herne Hill and the neighbourhood as it was in Browning's
youth will find an enthusiastic guide in the author of <i>Praeterita</i>.</p>

<p>Browning's childhood was a happy one. Indeed, if the poet had been able
to teach in song only what he had learnt in suffering, the larger part
of his verse would be singularly barren of interest. From first to last
everything went well with him, with the exception of a single
<a name="page24" id="page24">profound</a> grief. This must be borne in
mind by those who would estimate aright the genius of Robert Browning.
It would be affectation or folly to deny that his splendid physique--a
paternal inheritance, for his father died at the age of eighty-four,
without having ever endured a day's illness--and the exceptionally
fortunate circumstances which were his throughout life, had something
to do with that superb faith of his which finds concentrated expression
in the lines in Pippa's song--"God's in His Heaven, All's right with the world!"</p>

<p>It is difficult for a happy man with an imperturbable digestion to be a
pessimist. He is always inclined to give Nature the benefit of the
doubt. His favourite term for this mental complaisance is "catholicity
of faith," or, it may be, "a divine hope." The less fortunate brethren
bewail the laws of Nature, and doubt a future readjustment, because of
stomachs chronically out of order. An eminent author with a weak
digestion wrote to me recently animadverting on what he calls Browning's
insanity of optimism: it required no personal acquaintanceship to
discern the dyspeptic well-spring of this utterance. All this may be
admitted lightly without carrying the physiological argument to
extremes. A man may have a liberal hope for himself and for humanity,
although his dinner be habitually a martyrdom. After all, we are only
dictated to by our bodies: we have not perforce to obey them. A bitter
wit once remarked that the soul, if it were ever discovered, would be
found embodied in the gastric juice. He was not altogether a fool, this
man who had learnt in suffering what he taught in epigram; yet was he
wide of the mark.</p>

<p><a name="page25" id="page25">As</a> a very young child Browning was
keenly susceptible to music. One afternoon his mother was playing in the
twilight to herself. She was startled to hear a sound behind her.
Glancing round, she beheld a little white figure distinct against an
oak bookcase, and could just discern two large wistful eyes looking
earnestly at her. The next moment the child had sprung into her arms,
sobbing passionately at he knew not what, but, as his paroxysm of
emotion subsided, whispering over and over, with shy urgency, "Play! play!"</p>

<p>It is strange that among all his father's collection of drawings and
engravings nothing had such fascination for him as an engraving of a
picture of Andromeda and Perseus by Caravaggio. The story of the
innocent victim and the divine deliverer was one of which in his boyhood
he never tired of hearing: and as he grew older the charm of its
pictorial presentment had for him a deeper and more complex
significance. We have it on the authority of a friend that Browning had
this engraving always before his eyes as he wrote his earlier poems. He
has given beautiful commemoration to his feeling for it in "Pauline":--</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p><span class="in12">"Andromeda!</span><br />
     And she is with me--years roll, I shall change,<br />
     But change can touch her not--so beautiful<br />
     With her dark eyes, earnest and still, and hair<br />
     Lifted and spread by the salt-sweeping breeze;<br />
     And one red beam, all the storm leaves in heaven,<br />
     Resting upon her eyes and face and hair,<br />
     As she awaits the snake on the wet beach,<br />
     By the dark rock, and the white wave just breaking<br />
     At her feet; quite naked and alone,--a thing<br />
     You doubt not, nor fear for, secure that God<br />
     Will come in thunder from the stars to save her."</p>
</div>

<p><a name="page26" id="page26">One</a> of his own early recollections
was that of sitting on his father's knees in the library, and listening
with enthralled attention to the Tale of Troy, with marvellous
illustrations among the glowing coals in the fireplace; with, below all,
the vaguely heard accompaniment--from the neighbouring room where
Mrs. Browning sat "in her chief happiness, her hour of darkness and
solitude and music"--of a wild Gaelic lament, with its insistent
falling cadences. A story concerning his poetic precocity has been
circulated, but is not worth repeating. Most children love jingling
rhymes, and one need not be a born genius to improvise a
rhyming couplet on an occasion.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that in nothing in these early poemicules, in such
at least as have been preserved without the poet's knowledge and against
his will, is there anything of genuine promise. Hundreds of youngsters
have written as good, or better, Odes to the Moon, Stanzas on a
Favourite Canary, Lines on a Butterfly. What is much more to the point
is, that at the age of eight he was able not only to read, but to take
delight in Pope's translation of Homer. He used to go about declaiming
certain couplets with an air of intense earnestness highly diverting to
those who overheard him.</p>

<p>About this time also he began to translate the simpler odes of Horace.
One of these (viii. Bk. II.) long afterwards suggested to him the theme
of his "Instans Tyrannus." It has been put on record that his sister
remembers him, as a very little boy, walking round and round the
dining-room table, and spanning out the scansion of his verses with his
hand on the smooth <a name="page27" id="page27">mahogany</a>. He was
scarce more than a child when, one Guy Fawkes' day, he heard a woman
singing an unfamiliar song, whose burden was, "Following the Queen
of the Gipsies, O!" This refrain haunted him often in the after years.
That beautiful fantastic romance, "The Flight of the Duchess," was born
out of an insistent memory of this woman's snatch of song, heard in
childhood. He was ten when, after several <i>passions malheureuses</i>,
this precocious Lothario plunged into a love affair whose intensity
was only equalled by its hopelessness. A trifle of fifteen years'
seniority and a husband complicated matters, but it was not till
after the reckless expenditure of a Horatian ode upon an unclassical
mistress that he gave up hope. The outcome of this was what the elder
Browning regarded as a startling effusion of much Byronic verse.
The young Robert yearned for wastes of ocean and illimitable sands,
for dark eyes and burning caresses, for despair that nothing could
quench but the silent grave, and, in particular, for hollow mocking
laughter. His father looked about for a suitable school, and decided
to entrust the boy's further education to Mr. Ready, of Peckham.</p>

<p>Here he remained till he was fourteen. But already he knew the dominion
of dreams. His chief enjoyment, on holiday afternoons, was to gain an
unfrequented spot, where three huge elms re-echoed the tones of
incoherent human music borne thither-ward by the west winds across the
wastes of London. Here he loved to lie and dream. Alas, those elms, that
high remote coign, have long since passed to the "hidden way" whither
the snows of yester year <a name="page28" id="page28">have</a> vanished.
He would lie for hours looking upon distant London--a golden city of the
west literally enough, oftentimes, when the sunlight came streaming in
long shafts from behind the towers of Westminster and flashed upon the
gold cross of St. Paul's. The coming and going of the cloud-shadows,
the sweeping of sudden rains, the dull silvern light emanating from
the haze of mist shrouding the vast city, with the added transitory
gleam of troubled waters, the drifting of fogs, at that distance
seeming like gigantic veils constantly being moved forward and then
slowly withdrawn, as though some sinister creature of the atmosphere
were casting a net among all the dross and d&eacute;bris of human life
for fantastic sustenance of its own--all this endless, ever-changing,
always novel phantasmagoria had for him an extraordinary fascination.
One of the memorable nights of his boyhood was an eve when he found
his way, not without perturbation of spirit because of the unfamiliar
solitary dark, to his loved elms. There, for the first time, he beheld
London by night. It seemed to him then more wonderful and appalling than
all the host of stars. There was something ominous in that heavy
pulsating breath: visible, in a waning and waxing of the tremulous,
ruddy glow above the black enmassed leagues of masonry; audible, in
the low inarticulate moaning borne eastward across the crests of Norwood.
It was then and there that the tragic significance of life first dimly
awed and appealed to his questioning spirit: that the rhythm of humanity
first touched deeply in him a corresponding chord.</p>

<hr class="long" />

<h2><a name="page29" id="page29">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p>It was certainly about this time, as he admitted once in one of his rare
reminiscent moods, that Browning felt the artistic impulse stirring
within him, like the rising of the sap in a tree. He remembered his
mother's music, and hoped to be a musician: he recollected his father's
drawings, and certain seductive landscapes and seascapes by painters
whom he had heard called "the Norwich men," and he wished to be an
artist: then reminiscences of the Homeric lines he loved, of haunting
verse-melodies, moved him most of all.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"I shall never, in the years remaining,<br />
      Paint you pictures, no, nor carve you statues,<br />
      Make you music that should all-express me:<br />
      . . . verse alone, one life allows me."</p>
</div>

<p>He now gave way to the compulsive Byronic vogue, with an occasional
relapse to the polished artificialism of his father's idol among British
poets. There were several ballads written at this time: if I remember
aright, the poet specified the "Death of Harold" as the theme of one.
Long afterwards he read these boyish forerunners of "Over the sea our
galleys went," and "How they Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix,"
and was amused by their derivative if delicate melodies. Mrs. Browning
was very proud of <a name="page30" id="page30">these</a> early blooms
of song, and when her twelve-year-old son, tired of vain efforts to
seduce a publisher from the wary ways of business, surrendered in
disgust his neatly copied out and carefully stitched MSS., she lost
no opportunity--when Mr. Browning was absent--to expatiate upon their
merits. Among the people to whom she showed them was a Miss Flower.
This lady took them home, perused them, discerned dormant genius
lurking behind the boyish handwriting, read them to her sister
(afterwards to become known as Sarah Flower Adams), copied them out
before returning them, and persuaded the celebrated Rev. William
Johnson Fox to read the transcripts. Mr. Fox agreed with Miss
Flower as to the promise, but not altogether as to the actual
accomplishment, nor at all as to the advisability of publication. The
originals are supposed to have been destroyed by the poet during the
eventful period when, owing to a fortunate gift, poetry became a new
thing for him: from a dream, vague, if seductive, as summer-lightning,
transformed to a dominating reality. Passing a bookstall one day, he
saw, in a box of second-hand volumes, a little book advertised as "Mr.
Shelley's Atheistical Poem: very scarce." He had never heard of Shelley,
nor did he learn for a long time that the "D&aelig;mon of the World," and the
miscellaneous poems appended thereto, constituted a literary piracy.
Badly printed, shamefully mutilated, these discarded blossoms touched
him to a new emotion. Pope became further removed than ever: Byron,
even, lost his magnetic supremacy. From vague remarks in reply to his
inquiries, and from one or two casual allusions, he learned that there
really was a poet <a name="page31" id="page31">called</a> Shelley;
that he had written several volumes; that he was dead.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, Browning declared once that the news of this
unknown singer's death affected him more poignantly than did, a year or
less earlier, the tidings of Byron's heroic end at Missolonghi. He
begged his mother to procure him Shelley's works, a request not easily
complied with, for the excellent reason that not one of the local
booksellers had even heard of the poet's name. Ultimately, however, Mrs.
Browning learned that what she sought was procurable at the Olliers' in
Vere Street, London.</p>

<p>She was very pleased with the result of her visit. The books, it is
true, seemed unattractive: but they would please Robert, no doubt. If
that packet had been lost we should not have had "Pauline": we might
have had a different Browning. It contained most of Shelley's writings,
all in their first edition, with the exception of "The Cenci": in
addition, there were three volumes by an even less known poet, John
Keats, which kindly Mrs. Browning had been persuaded to include in her
purchase on Mr. Ollier's assurance that they were the poetic kindred of
Shelley's writings, and that Mr. Keats was the subject of the elegiac
poem in the purple paper cover, with the foreign-looking type and the
imprint "Pisa" at the foot of the title-page, entitled "Adonais." What
an evening for the young poet that must have been. He told a friend it
was a May night, and that in a laburnum, "heavy with its weight of
gold," and in a great copper-beech at the end of a neighbour's garden,
two nightingales strove one against the other. For a moment it is a
pleasant fancy to imagine that <a name="page32" id="page32">there</a>
the souls of Keats and Shelley uttered their enfranchised music, not
in rivalry but in welcome. We can realise, perhaps, something of the
startled delight, of the sudden electric tremors, of the young poet
when, with eager eyes, he turned over the pages of "Epipsychidion" or
"Prometheus Unbound," "Alastor" or "Endymion," or the Odes to a
Nightingale, on Melancholy, on a Grecian Urn.</p>

<p>More than once Browning alluded to this experience as his first
pervasive joy, his first free happiness in outlook. Often in after life
he was fain, like his "wise thrush," to "recapture that first fine
careless rapture." It was an eventful eve.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"And suddenly, without heart-wreck, I awoke<br />
      As from a dream."</p>
</div>

<p>Thenceforth his poetic development was rapid, and continuous. Shelley
enthralled him most. The fire and spirit of the great poet's verse, wild
and strange often, but ever with an exquisiteness of music which seemed
to his admirer, then and later, supreme, thrilled him to a very passion
of delight. Something of the more richly coloured, the more human rhythm
of Keats affected him also. Indeed, a line from the Ode to a
Nightingale, in common with one of the loveliest passages in
"Epipsychidion," haunted him above all others: and again and again in
his poems we may encounter vague echoes of those "remote isles" and
"perilous seas"--as, for example, in "the dim clustered isles of the
blue sea" of "Pauline," and the "some isle, with the sea's silence on
it--some unsuspected isle in the far seas!" of "Pippa Passes."</p>

<p><a name="page33" id="page33">But</a> of course he had other matters
for mental occupation besides poetry. His education at Mr. Ready's
private academy seems to have been excellent so far as it went. He
remained there till he was fourteen. Perhaps because of the few
boarders at the school, possibly from his own reticence in self
disclosure, he does not seem to have impressed any school-mate deeply.
We hear of no one who "knew Browning at school." His best education,
after all, was at home. His father and mother incidentally taught him
as much as Mr. Ready: his love of painting and music was fostered,
indirectly: and in the 'dovecot' bookshelf above the fireplace in his
bedroom, were the precious volumes within whose sway and magic was
his truest life.</p>

<p>His father, for some reason which has not been made public, but was
doubtless excellent, and is, in the light in which we now regard it, a
matter for which to be thankful, decided to send his son neither to a
large public school, nor, later, to Oxford or Cambridge. A more
stimulative and wider training was awaiting him elsewhere.</p>

<p>For a time Robert's education was superintended by a tutor, who came to
the house in Camberwell for several hours daily. The afternoons were
mainly devoted to music, to exercise, and occasionally to various
experimental studies in technical science. In the evenings, after his
preparatory tasks were over, when he was not in the entertaining company
of his father, he read and assiduously wrote. After poetry, he cared
most for history: but as a matter of fact, little came amiss to his
eager intellectual appetite. It was a period of
<a name="page34" id="page34">growth</a>, with, it may be, a vague
consciousness that his mind was expanding towards compulsive expression.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"So as I grew, I rudely shaped my life<br />
      To my immediate wants, yet strong beneath<br />
      Was a vague sense of powers folded up--<br />
      A sense that though those shadowy times were past,<br />
      Their spirit dwelt in me, and I should rule."</p>
</div>

<p>When Mr. Browning was satisfied that the tutor had fulfilled his duty he
sent his son to attend a few lectures at University College, in Gower
Street, then just founded. Robert Browning's name is on the registrar's
books for the opening session, 1829-30. "I attended with him the Greek
class of Professor Long" (wrote a friend, in the <i>Times</i>, Dec. 14:'89),
"and I well recollect the esteem and regard in which he was held by his
fellow-students. He was then a bright, handsome youth, with long black
hair falling over his shoulders." So short was his period of attendance,
however, and so unimportant the instruction he there derived, that to
all intents it may be said Browning had no University training.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Browning but slightly appreciated his
son's poetic idols and already found himself in an opposite literary
camp, he had a profound sympathy with the boy's ideals and no little
confidence in his powers. When the test came he acted wisely as well as
with affectionate complaisance. In a word, he practically left the
decision as to his course of life to Robert himself. The latter was
helped thereto by the knowledge that his sister would be provided for,
and that, if need be, there was sufficient for himself also.
<a name="page35" id="page35">There</a> was of course but one way open
to him. He would not have been a true poet, an artist, if he had
hesitated. With a strange misconception of the artistic spirit,
some one has awarded the poet great credit for his choice, because
he had "the singular courage to decline to be rich." Browning himself
had nothing of this bourgeois spirit: he was the last man to speak of
an inevitable artistic decision as "singular courage." There are no
doubt people who estimate his resolve as Mr. Barrett, so his daughter
declared, regarded Horne when he heard of that poet having
published "Orion" at a farthing: "Perhaps he is going to shoot the
Queen, and is preparing evidence of monomania."</p>

<p>With Browning there never could have been two sides to the question: it
were excusable, it were natural even, had his father wavered. The
outcome of their deliberations was that Robert's further education
should be obtained from travel, and intercourse with men and foreign
literatures.</p>

<p>By this time the poet was twenty. His youth had been uneventful; in a
sense, more so than his boyhood. His mind, however, was rapidly
unfolding, and great projects were casting a glory about the coming
days. It was in his nineteenth year, I have been told on good authority,
that he became ardently in love with a girl of rare beauty, a year or
two older than himself, but otherwise, possibly, no inappropriate lover
for this wooer. Why and when this early passion came to a close, or was
rudely interrupted, is not known. What is certain is that it made a deep
impression on the poet's mind. It may be that it, of itself, or wrought
to a higher emotion by his hunger after ideal beauty, was the source of
<a name="page36" id="page36">"Pauline,"</a> that very unequal but yet
beautiful first fruit of Browning's genius.</p>

<p>It was not till within the last few years that the poet spoke at all
freely of his youthful life. Perhaps the earliest record of these
utterances is that which appeared in the <i>Century Magazine</i> in 1881.
From this source, and from what the poet himself said at various times
and in various ways, we know that just about the time Balzac, after
years of apparently waste labour, was beginning to forecast the Titanic
range of the <i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i>, Browning planned "a series of
monodramatic epics, narratives of the life of typical souls--a gigantic
scheme at which a Victor Hugo or a Lope de Vega would start back
aghast."</p>

<p>Already he had set himself to the analysis of the human soul in its
manifold aspects, already he had recognised that for him at least there
was no other study worthy of a lifelong devotion. In a sense he has
fulfilled this early dream: at any rate we have a unique series of
monodramatic poems, illustrative of typical souls. In another sense, the
major portion of Browning's life-work is, collectively, one monodramatic
"epic." He is himself a type of the subtle, restless, curious, searching
modern age of which he is the profoundest interpreter. Through a
multitude of masks he, the typical soul, speaks, and delivers himself of
a message which could not be presented emphatically enough as the
utterance of a single individual. He is a true dramatic poet, though not
in the sense in which Shakspere is. Shakspere and his kindred project
themselves into the lives of their imaginary personages: Browning pays
little heed to external life, or to the <a name="page37" id="page37">exigencies</a>
of action, and projects himself into the minds of his characters.</p>

<p>In a word, Shakspere's method is to depict a human soul in action, with
all the pertinent play of circumstance, while Browning's is to portray
the processes of its mental and spiritual development: as he said in his
dedicatory preface to "Sordello," "little else is worth study." The one
electrifies us with the outer and dominant actualities; the other
flashes upon our mental vision the inner, complex, shaping
potentialities. The one deals with life dynamically, the other with life
as Thought. Both methods are compassed by art. Browning, who is above
all modern writers the poet of dramatic situations, is surpassed by many
of inferior power in continuity of dramatic sequence. His finest work is
in his dramatic poems, rather than in his dramas. He realised intensely
the value of quintessential moments, as when the Prefect in "The Return
of the Druses" thrusts aside the arras, muttering that for the first
time he enters without a sense of imminent doom, "no draught coming as
from a sepulchre" saluting him, while that moment the dagger of the
assassin plunges to his heart: or, further in the same poem, when Anael,
coming to denounce Djabal as an impostor, is overmastered by her
tyrannic love, and falls dead with the too bitter freight of her
emotion, though not till she has proclaimed him the God by her single
worshipping cry, <i>Hakeem!</i>--or, once more, in "The Ring and the Book,"
where, with the superbest close of any dramatic poem in our literature,
the wretched Guido, at the point of death, cries out in the last
extremity not upon God or the Virgin, but upon his innocent and
<a name="page38" id="page38">murdered</a> wife--"Abate,--Cardinal,--Christ,--Maria,--God,
... Pompilia, will you let them murder me?" Thus we can imagine Browning,
with his characteristic perception of the profound significance of a
circumstance or a single word even, having written of the knocking at
the door in "Macbeth," or having used, with all its marvellous cumulative
effect, the word 'wrought' towards the close of "Othello," when the Moor
cries in his bitterness of soul, "But being wrought, perplext in the extreme":
we can imagine this, and yet could not credit the suggestion that even
the author of "The Ring and the Book" could by any possibility have
composed the two most moving tragedies writ in our tongue.</p>

<p>In the late autumn of 1832 Browning wrote a poem of singular promise and
beauty, though immature in thought and crude in expression.
<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref6" id="fnref6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></span>
Thirty-four years later he included "Pauline" in his "Poetical Works"
with reluctance, and in a note explained the reason of his
decision--namely, to forestall piratical reprints abroad. "The thing was
my earliest attempt at 'poetry always dramatic in principle, and so many
utterances of so many imaginary persons, not mine,' which I have since
written according to a scheme less extravagant, and scale less
impracticable, than were ventured upon in this crude preliminary
sketch--a sketch that, on <a name="page39" id="page39">reviewal</a>,
appears not altogether wide of some hint of the characteristic features
of that particular <i>dramatis persona</i> it would fain have reproduced:
good draughtsmanship, however, and right handling were far beyond the
artist at that time." These be hard words. No critic will ever adventure
upon so severe a censure of "Pauline": most capable judges agree that,
with all its shortcomings, it is a work of genius, and therefore ever
to be held treasurable for its own sake as well as for its significance.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn6" id="fn6" href="#fnref6">[6]</a></span>
Probably from the fact of "Richmond" having been added to
the date at the end of the preface to "Pauline," have arisen the
frequent misstatements as to the Browning family having moved west from
Camberwell in or shortly before 1832. Mr. R. Barrett Browning tells me
that his father "never lived at Richmond, and that that place was
connected with 'Pauline,' when first printed, as a mystification."
</div>

<p>On the fly-leaf of a copy of this initial work, the poet, six years
after its publication, wrote: "Written in pursuance of a foolish plan I
forget, or have no wish to remember; the world was never to guess that
such an opera, such a comedy, such a speech proceeded from the same
notable person.... Only this crab remains of the shapely Tree of Life in
my fool's Paradise." It was in conformity with this plan that he not
only issued "Pauline" anonymously, but enjoined secrecy upon those to
whom he communicated the fact of his authorship.</p>

<p>When he read the poem to his parents, upon its conclusion, both were
much impressed by it, though his father made severe strictures upon its
lack of polish, its terminal inconcision, and its vagueness of thought.
That he was not more severe was accepted by his son as high praise. The
author had, however, little hope of seeing it in print. Mr. Browning was
not anxious to provide a publisher with a present. So one day the poet
was gratified when his aunt, handing him the requisite sum, remarked
that she had heard he had written a fine poem, and that she wished to
have the pleasure of seeing it in print.</p>

<p><a name="page40" id="page40">To</a> this kindly act much was due.
Browning, of course, could not now have been dissuaded from the career
he had forecast for himself, but his progress might have been retarded
or thwarted to less fortunate grooves, had it not been for the
circumstances resultant from his aunt's timely gift.</p>

<p>The MS. was forthwith taken to Saunders &amp; Otley, of Conduit Street, and
the little volume of seventy pages of blank verse, comprising only a
thousand and thirty lines, was issued by them in January 1833. It seems
to us, who read it now, so manifestly a work of exceptional promise,
and, to a certain extent, of high accomplishment, that were it not for
the fact that the public auditory for a new poet is ever extraordinarily
limited, it would be difficult to understand how it could have been
overlooked.</p>

<p>"Pauline" has a unique significance because of its autopsychical hints.
The Browning whom we all know, as well as the youthful dreamer, is here
revealed; here too, as well as the disciple of Shelley, we have the
author of "The Ring and the Book." In it the long series culminating in
"Asolando" is foreshadowed, as the oak is observable in the sapling. The
poem is prefaced by a Latin motto from the <i>Occult Philosophy</i> of
Cornelius Agrippa, and has also a note in French, set forth as being by
Pauline, and appended to her lover's manuscript after his death.
Probably Browning placed it in the mouth of Pauline from his rooted
determination to speak dramatically and impersonally: and in French, so
as to heighten the effect of verisimilitude.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref7" id="fnref7" href="#fn7">[7]</a></span></p>

"I much fear that my poor friend will not be always
perfectly understood in what remains to be read of this strange
fragment, but it is less calculated than any other part to explain what
of its nature can never be anything but dream and confusion. I do not
know, moreover, whether in striving at a better connection of certain
parts, one would not run the risk of detracting from the only merit to
which so singular a production can pretend--that of giving a tolerably
precise idea of the manner (<i>genre</i>) which it can merely indicate. This
unpretending opening, this stir of passion, which first increases, and
then gradually subsides, these transports of the soul, this sudden
return upon himself, and above all, my friend's quite peculiar turn of
mind, have made alterations almost impossible. The reasons which he
elsewhere asserts, and others still more cogent, have secured my
indulgence for this paper, which otherwise I should have advised him to
throw into the fire. I believe none the less in the great principle of
all composition--in that principle of Shakespeare, of Raphael, and of
Beethoven, according to which concentration of ideas is due much more to
their conception than to their execution; I have every reason to fear
that the first of these qualities is still foreign to my friend, and I
much doubt whether redoubled labour would enable him to acquire the
second. It would be best to burn this, but what can I do?"--<i>(Mrs.
Orr</i>.)
</div>

<p><a name="page41" id="page41">"Pauline"</a> is a confession, fragmentary
in detail but synthetic in range, of a young man of high impulses but
weak determination. In its over-emphasis upon errors of judgment, as
well as upon real if exaggerated misdeeds, it has all the crudeness of
youth. An almost fantastic self-consciousness is the central motive: it
is a matter of question if this be absolutely vicarious. To me it seems
that the author himself was at the time confused by the complicated
flashing of the lights of life.</p>

<p>The autobiographical and autopsychical lines and passages scattered
through the poem are of immediate interest. Generously the poet repays
his debt to Shelley, whom he apostrophises as "Sun-treader," and invokes
in strains of lofty emotion--"Sun-treader--life and light be thine for
ever." The music of "Alastor," indeed, is <a name="page42" id="page42">audible</a>
ever and again throughout "Pauline." None the less is there a new music,
a new poetic voice, in</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Thou wilt remember one warm morn, when Winter<br />
      Crept aged from the earth, and Spring's first breath<br />
      Blew soft from the moist hills--the black-thorn boughs,<br />
      So dark in the bare wood, when glistening<br />
      In the sunshine were white with coming buds,<br />
      Like the bright side of a sorrow--and the banks<br />

     <p class="quote">"I seemed the fate from which I fled; I felt<br />
      A strange delight in causing my decay;<br />
      I was a fiend, in darkness chained for ever<br />
      Within some ocean-wave:"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">we have the real Browning in</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"So I will sing on--fast as fancies come<br />
      Rudely--the verse being as the mood it paints.<br />

      I am made up of an intensest life,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and all the succeeding lines down to "Their spirit
dwelt in me, and I should rule."</p>

<p>Even then the poet's inner life was animated by his love of the
beautiful Greek literature. Telling how in "the first dawn of life,"
"which passed alone with wisest ancient books," Pauline's lover
incorporated himself in whatsoever he read--was the god wandering after
beauty, the giant standing vast against the sunset-light, the
high-crested chief sailing with troops of friends to Tenedos--his
second-self cries, "I tell you, nought has ever been so clear as the
<a name="page43" id="page43">place</a>, the time, the fashion of those
lives." Never for him, then, had there been that alchemy of the soul
which turns the inchoate drift of the world into golden ore, not then
had come to him the electric awakening flash from "work of lofty art,
nor woman's beauty, nor sweet nature's face"--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Yet, I say, never morn broke clear as those<br />
      On the dim clustered isles in the blue sea:<br />
      The deep groves, and white temples, and wet caves--<br />
      And nothing ever will surprise me now--<br />
      Who stood beside the naked Swift-footed,<br />
      Who bound my forehead with Proserpine's hair."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Further, the allusion to Plato, and the more remote
one to Agamemnon, the</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in12">"old lore</span><br />
      Loved for itself, and all it shows--the King<br />
      Treading the purple calmly to his death,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the beautiful Andromeda passage, afford ample
indication of how deeply Browning had drunk of that vital stream whose
waters are the surest conserver of the ideal loveliness which we all
of us, in some degree, cherish in various guises.</p>

<p>Yet, as in every long poem that he has written (and, it must be
admitted, in too many of the shorter pieces of his later period) there
is an alloy of prose, of something that is not poetry, so in "Pauline,"
written though it was in the first flush of his genius and under the
inspiring stimulus of Shelley, the reader encounters prosaic passages,
decasyllabically arranged. "Twas in my plan to look on real life, which
was all new to me; my theories were firm, so I left them, to look upon
men, <a name="page44" id="page44">and</a> their cares, and hopes, and
fears, and joys; and, as I pondered on them all, I sought how best life's
end might be attained, an end comprising every joy." Again: "Then came a
pause, and long restraint chained down my soul, till it was changed. I
lost myself, and were it not that I so loathe that time, I could recall
how first I learned to turn my mind against itself ... at length I was
restored, yet long the influence remained; and nought but the still
life I led, apart from all, which left my soul to seek its old delights,
could e'er have brought me thus far back to peace." No reader, alert to
the subtle and haunting music of rarefied blank verse (and unless it be
rarefied it should not be put forward as poetry), could possibly accept
these lines as expressionally poetical. It would seem as though, from
the first, Browning's ear was keener for the apprehension than for the
sustained evocation of the music of verse. Some flaw there was, somewhere.
His heart, so to say, beat too fast, and the singing in his ears from the
o'er-fevered blood confused the serene rhythm haunting the far
perspectives of the brain, "as Arab birds float sleeping in the wind."</p>

<p>I have dwelt at this length upon "Pauline" partly because of its
inherent beauty and autopsychical significance, and partly because it is
the least familiar of Browning's poems, long overshadowed as it has been
by his own too severe strictures: mainly, however, because of its
radical importance to the student who would arrive at a broad and true
estimate of the power and scope and shaping constituents of its author's
genius. Almost every quality of his after-verse may be found here, in
germ or outline. It is, in a word, more physiognomic
<a name="page45" id="page45">than</a> any other single poem
by Browning, and so must ever possess a peculiar interest
quite apart from its many passages of haunting beauty.</p>

<p>To these the lover of poetry will always turn with delight. Some will
even regard them retrospectively with alien emotion to that wherewith
they strive to possess their souls in patience over some one or other of
the barbarisms, the Titanic excesses, the poetic banalities recurrent in
the later volumes.</p>

<p>How many and how haunting these delicate oases are! Those who know and
love "Pauline" will remember the passage where the poet, with that
pantheistic ecstasy which was possibly inspired by the singer he most
loved, tells how he can live the life of plants, content to watch the
wild bees flitting to and fro, or to lie absorbent of the ardours of the
sun, or, like the night-flowering columbine, to trail up the tree-trunk
and through its rustling foliage "look for the dim stars;" or, again,
can live the life of the bird, "leaping airily his pyramid of leaves and
twisted boughs of some tall mountain-tree;" or be a fish, breathing the
morning air in the misty sun-warm water. Close following this is another
memorable passage, that beginning "Night, and one single ridge of narrow
path;" which has a particular interest for two notes of a deeper and
broader music to be evolved long afterwards. For, as it seems to me, in</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Thou art so close by me, the roughest swell<br />
      Of wind in the tree-tops hides not the panting<br />
      Of thy soft breasts -----"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(where, by the way, should be noticed the subtle
correspondence between the conceptive and the expressional
<a name="page46" id="page46">rhythm</a>) we have a hint of that
superb scene in "Pippa Passes," where, on a sinister night of July, a
night of spiritual storm as well as of aerial tempest, Ottima and Sebald
lie amid the lightning-searcht forest, with "the thunder like a whole
sea overhead." Again, in the lovely Turneresque, or rather Shelleyan
picture of morning, over "the rocks, and valleys, and old woods," with
the high boughs swinging in the wind above the sun-brightened mists, and
the golden-coloured spray of the cataract amid the broken rocks,
whereover the wild hawks fly to and fro, there is at least a suggestion,
an outline, of the truly magnificent burst of morning music in the
poet's penultimate volume, beginning--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"But morning's laugh sets all the crags alight<br />
      Above the baffled tempest: tree and tree<br />
      Stir themselves from the stupor of the night,<br />
      And every strangled branch resumes its right<br />
      To breathe, shakes loose dark's clinging dregs, waves free<br />
      In dripping glory. Prone the runnels plunge,<br />
      While earth, distent with moisture like a sponge,<br />
      Smokes up, and leaves each plant its gem to see,<br />
      Each grass-blade's glory-glitter," etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Who that has ever read "Pauline" will forget the masterful poetry
descriptive of the lover's wild-wood retreat, the exquisite lines
beginning "Walled in with a sloped mound of matted shrubs, tangled, old
and green"? There is indeed a new, an unmistakable voice here.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"And tongues of bank go shelving in the waters,<br />
      Where the pale-throated snake reclines his head,<br />
      And old grey stones lie making eddies there;<br />
      The wild mice cross them dry-shod"....</p>
</div>

<p><a name="page47" id="page47">What</a> lovelier image in modern poetry
than that depictive of the forest-pool in depths of savage woodlands,
unvisited but by the shadows of passing clouds,--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in5">"the trees bend</span><br />
      O'er it as wild men watch a sleeping girl."</p>
</div>

<p>How the passionate sexual emotion, always deep and true in Browning,
finds lovely utterance in the lines where Pauline's lover speaks of the
blood in her lips pulsing like a living thing, while her neck is as
"marble misted o'er with love-breath," and</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"... her delicious eyes as clear as heaven,<br />
      When rain in a quick shower has beat down mist,<br />
      And clouds float white in the sun like broods of swans."</p>
</div>

<p>In the quotations I have made, and in others that might be selected
(<i>e.g.</i>, "Her fresh eyes, and soft hair, and <i>lips which bleed like a
mountain berry</i>"), it is easy to note how intimate an observer of nature
the youthful poet was, and with what conscious but not obtrusive art he
brings forward his new and striking imagery. Browning, indeed, is the
poet of new symbols.</p>

<p>"Pauline" concludes with lines which must have been in the minds of many
on that sad day when the tidings from Venice sent a thrill of startled,
half-incredulous, bewildered pain throughout the English nations--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Sun-treader, I believe in God, and truth,<br />
      And love; . . .<br />
      . . . but chiefly when I die . . .<br />
      All in whom this wakes pleasant thoughts of me,<br />
      Know my last state is happy--free from doubt,<br />
      Or touch of fear."</p>
</div>

<p><a name="page48" id="page48">Never</a> again was Browning to write
a poem with such conceptive crudeness, never again to tread the
byways of thought so falteringly or so negligently: but never again,
perhaps, was he to show so much over-rapturing joy in the world's
loveliness, such Bacchic abandon to the ideal beauty which the true
poet sees glowing upon the forlornest height and brooding in the
shadow-haunted hollows of the hills. The Browning who might have
been is here: henceforth the Browning we know and love stands unique
among all the lords of song. But sometimes do we not turn longingly,
wonderingly at least, to the young Dionysos upon whose forehead was
the light of another destiny than that which descended upon him? The
Icelanders say there is a land where all the rainbows that have ever
been, or are yet to be, forever drift to and fro, evanishing and
reappearing, like immortal flowers of vapour. In that far country,
it may be, are also the unfulfilled dreams, the visions too perfect
to be fashioned into song, of the young poets who have gained the laurel.</p>

<p>We close the little book lovingly:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>It has been commonly asserted that "Pauline" was almost wholly
disregarded, and swiftly lapsed into oblivion.</p>

<p>This must be accepted with qualification. It is like the other general
assertion, that Browning had to live fifty years before he gained
recognition--a statement as ludicrous when examined as it is unjust to
the many discreet judges who awarded, publicly and privately, that
intelligent sympathy which is the best sunshine for the flower of a
poet's genius. If by "before he gained recognition" is meant a general
and indiscriminate acclaim, no doubt Browning had, still has indeed,
longer to wait than many other eminent writers have had to do: but it is
absurd to assert that from the very outset of his poetic career he was
met by nothing but neglect, if not scornful derision. None who knows the
true artistic temperament will fall into any such mistake.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that neither Shakspere nor Milton ever met with such
enthusiastic praise and welcome as Browning encountered on the
publication of "Pauline" and "Paracelsus." Shelley, as far above
Browning in poetic music as the author of so many parleyings with other
people's souls is the superior in psychic <a name="page50" id="page50">insight</a>
and intellectual strength, had throughout his too brief life not one such
review of praiseful welcome as the Rev. W.J. Fox wrote on the publication of
"Pauline" (or, it may be added, as Allan Cunningham's equally kindly but
less able review in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>), or as John Forster wrote in <i>The
Examiner</i> concerning "Paracelsus," and later in the <i>New Monthly
Magazine</i>, where he had the courage to say of the young and quite
unknown poet, "without the slightest hesitation we name Mr. Robert
Browning at once with Shelley, Coleridge, Wordsworth." His plays even
(which are commonly said to have "fallen flat") were certainly not
failures. There is something effeminate, undignified, and certainly
uncritical, in this confusion as to what is and what is not failure in
literature. So enthusiastic was the applause he encountered, indeed,
that had his not been too strong a nature to be thwarted by adulation
any more than by contemptuous neglect, he might well have become
spoilt--so enthusiastic, that were it not for the heavy and prolonged
counterbalancing dead weight of public indifference, a huge amorphous
mass only of late years moulded into harmony with the keenest minds of
the century, we might well be suspicious of so much and long-continued
eulogium, and fear the same reversal of judgment towards him on the part
of those who come after us as we ourselves have meted to many an one
among the high gods of our fathers.</p>

<p>Fortunately the deep humanity of his work in the mass conserves it
against the mere veerings of taste. A reaction against it will
inevitably come; but this will pass: what, in the future, when the
unborn readers of <a name="page51" id="page51">Browning</a> will look
back with clear eyes untroubled by the dust of our footsteps, not to
subside till long after we too are dust, will be the place given to
this poet, we know not, nor can more than speculatively estimate. That
it will, however, be a high one, so far as his weightiest (in bulk, it
may possibly be but a relatively slender) accomplishment is concerned,
we may rest well assured: for indeed "It lives, If precious be the soul
of man to man."</p>

<p>So far as has been ascertained there were only three reviews or notices
of "Pauline": the very favourable article by Mr. Fox in the <i>Monthly
Repository</i>, the kindly paper by Allan Cunningham in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
and, in <i>Tait's Edinburgh Magazine</i>, the succinctly expressed impression
of either an indolent or an incapable reviewer: "Pauline; a Fragment of
a Confession; a piece of pure bewilderment"--a "criticism" which
anticipated and thus prevented the insertion of a highly favourable
review which John Stuart Mill voluntarily wrote.</p>

<p>Browning must have regarded his first book with mingled feelings. It was
a bid for literary fortune, in one sense, but a bid so handicapped by
the circumstances of its publication as to be almost certainly of no
avail. Probably, however, he was well content that it should have mere
existence. Already the fever of an abnormal intellectual curiosity was
upon him: already he had schemed more potent and more vital poems:
already, even, he had developed towards a more individualistic method.
So indifferent was he to an easily gained reputation that he seems to
have been really urgent upon his relatives and intimate acquaintances
<a name="page52" id="page52">not</a> to betray his authorship. The Miss
Flower, how ever, to whom allusion has already been made, could not
repress her admiration to the extent of depriving her friend, Mr. Fox,
of a pleasure similar to that she had herself enjoyed. The result was
the generous notice in the <i>Monthly Repository</i>. The poet never
forgot his indebtedness to Mr. Fox, to whose sympathy and kindness
much direct and indirect good is traceable. The friendship then begun
was lifelong, and was continued with the distinguished Unitarian's
family when Mr. Fox himself ended his active and beneficent career.</p>

<p>But after a time the few admirers of "Pauline" forgot to speak about it:
the poet himself never alluded to it: and in a year or two it was almost
as though it had never been written. Many years after, when articles
upon Robert Browning were as numerous as they once had been scarce,
never a word betrayed that their authors knew of the existence of
"Pauline." There was, however, yet another friendship to come out of
this book, though not until long after it was practically forgotten by
its author.</p>

<p>One day a young poet-painter came upon a copy of the book in the British
Museum Library, and was at once captivated by its beauty. One of the
earliest admirers of Browning's poetry, Dante Gabriel Rossetti--for it
was he--felt certain that "Pauline" could be by none other than the
author of "Paracelsus." He himself informed me that he had never heard
this authorship suggested, though some one had spoken to him of a poem
of remarkable promise, called "Pauline," which he ought to read. If I
remember aright, Rossetti told me that it was on the forenoon of the day
when the <a name="page53" id="page53">"Burden of Nineveh"</a> was begun,
conceived rather, that he read this story of a soul by the soul's ablest
historian. So delighted was he with it, and so strong his opinion it was
by Browning, that he wrote to the poet, then in Florence, for confirmation,
stating at the same time that his admiration for "Pauline" had led him
to transcribe the whole of it.</p>

<p>Concerning this episode, Robert Browning wrote to me, some seven years
ago, as follows:--</p>

<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">"St. Pierre de Chartreuse,<br />
     Is&egrave;re, France.</p>

    <p>"Rossetti's 'Pauline' letter was addressed to me at Florence more
    than thirty years ago. I have preserved it, but, even were I at
    home, should be unable to find it without troublesome searching. It
    was to the effect that the writer, personally and altogether unknown
    to me, had come upon a poem in the British Museum, which he copied
    the whole of, from its being not otherwise procurable--that he
    judged it to be mine, but could not be sure, and wished me to
    pronounce in the matter--which I did. A year or two after, I had a
    visit in London from Mr. (William) Allingham and a friend--who
    proved to be Rossetti. When I heard he was a painter I insisted on
    calling on him, though he declared he had nothing to show me--which
    was far enough from the case. Subsequently, on another of my returns
    to London, he painted my portrait, not, I fancy, in oils, but
    water-colours, and finished it in Paris shortly after. This must
    have been in the year when Tennyson published 'Maud,' for I remember
    Tennyson reading the poem one evening while Rossetti made a rapid
    pen-and-ink sketch of him, very good, from one obscure corner of
    vantage, which I still possess, and duly value. This was before
    Rossetti's marriage."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref8" id="fnref8" href="#fn8">[8]</a></span></p>

The highly interesting and excellent portrait of Browning here alluded to
has never been exhibited.
</div>

<p><a name="page54" id="page54">As</a> a matter of fact, as recorded on
the back of the original drawing, the eventful reading took place at
13 Dorset Street, Portman Square, on the 27th of September 1855, and
those present, besides the Poet-Laureate, Browning, and Rossetti, were
Mrs. E. Barrett Browning and Miss Arabella Barrett.</p>

<p>When, a year or two ago, the poet learned that a copy of his first work,
which in 1833 could not find a dozen purchasers at a few shillings, went
at a public sale for twenty-five guineas, he remarked that had his dear
old aunt been living he could have returned to her, much to her
incredulous astonishment, no doubt, he smilingly averred, the cost of
the book's publication, less £3 15s. It was about the time of the
publication of "Pauline" that Browning began to see something of the
literary and artistic life for which he had such an inborn taste. For a
brief period he went often to the British Museum, particularly the
Library, and to the National Gallery. At the British Museum Reading Room
he perused with great industry and research those works in philosophy
and medical history which are the bases of "Paracelsus," and those
Italian Records bearing upon the story of Sordello. Residence in
Camberwell, in 1833, rendered night engagements often impracticable: but
nevertheless he managed to mix a good deal in congenial society. It is
not commonly known that he was familiar to these early associates as a
musician and artist rather than as a poet. Among them, and they
comprised many well-known workers in the several arts, were Charles
Dickens and "Ion" Talfourd. Mr. Fox, whom Browning had met once or twice
in his early youth, after the former had been shown the Byronic verses
which had in one <a name="page55" id="page55">way</a> gratified and in
another way perturbed the poet's father, saw something more of his young
friend after the publication of "Pauline." He very kindly offered to print
in his magazine any short poems the author of that book should see fit
to send--an offer, however, which was not put to the test for some time.</p>

<p>Practically simultaneously with the publication of "Pauline" appeared
another small volume, containing the "Palace of Art," "Oenone,"
"Mariana," etc. Those early books of Tennyson and Browning have
frequently, and somewhat uncritically, been contrasted. Unquestionably,
however, the elder poet showed a consummate and continuous mastery of
his art altogether beyond the intermittent expressional power of
Browning in his most rhythmic emotion at any time of his life. To affirm
that there is more intellectual fibre, what Rossetti called fundamental
brain-work, in the product of the younger poet, would be beside the
mark. The insistence on the supremacy of Browning over all poets since
Shakspere because he has the highest "message" to deliver, because his
intellect is the most subtle and comprehensive, because his poems have
this or that dynamic effect upon dormant or sluggish or other active
minds, is to be seriously and energetically deprecated. It is with
presentment that the artist has, fundamentally, to concern himself. If
he cannot <i>present</i> poetically then he is not, in effect, a poet, though
he may be a poetic thinker, or a great writer. Browning's eminence is
not because of his detachment from what some one has foolishly called
"the mere handiwork, the furnisher's business, of the poet." It is
<a name="page56" id="page56">the</a> delight of the true artist that
the product of his talent should be wrought to a high technique equally
by the shaping brain and the dexterous hand. Browning is great because
of his formative energy: because, despite the excess of burning and
compulsive thought--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Thoughts swarming thro' the myriad-chambered brain<br />
      Like multitudes of bees i' the innumerous cells,<br />
      Each staggering 'neath the undelivered freight ----"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he strikes from the <i>furor</i> of words an electric
flash so transcendently illuminative that what is commonplace becomes
radiant with that light which dwells not in nature, but only in the
visionary eye of man. Form for the mere beauty of form, is a playing
with the wind, the acceptance of a shadow for the substance. If nothing
animate it, it may possibly be fair of aspect, but only as the frozen
smile upon a dead face.</p>

<p>We know little of Browning's inner or outer life in 1833 and 1834. It
was a secretive, not a productive period. One by one certain pinnacles
of his fair snow-mountain of Titanic aim melted away. He began to
realise the first disenchantment of the artist: the sense of dreams
never to be accomplished. That land of the great unwritten poems, the
great unpainted pictures: what a heritance there for the enfranchised
spirits of great dreamers!</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1833 he went forth to his University, that of the world
of men and women. It was ever a favourite answer of his, when asked if
he had been at either Oxford or Cambridge,--"Italy was my University."</p>

<p><a name="page57" id="page57">But</a> first he went to Russia, and spent
some time in St. Petersburg, attracted thither by the invitation of a
friend. The country interested him, but does not seem to have deeply or
permanently engaged his attention. That, however, his Russian experiences
were not fruitless is manifest from the remarkably picturesque and
technically very interesting poem, "Iv&agrave;n Iv&agrave;novitch"
(the fourth of the <i>Dramatic Idyls</i>, 1879). Of a truth, after
his own race and country--readers will at once think of "Home Thoughts
from the Sea," or the thrilling lines in "Home Thoughts from Abroad,"
beginning--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Oh, to be in England,<br />
      Now that April's there!"--</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or perhaps, those lines in his earliest work--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in8">"I cherish most</span><br />
      My love of England--how, her name, a word<br />
      Of hers in a strange tongue makes my heart beat!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">--it was of the mystic Orient or of the glowing South
that he oftenest thought and dreamed. With Heine he might have cried:
"O Firdusi! O Ischami! O Saadi! How do I long after the roses of Schiraz!"
As for Italy, who of all our truest poets has not loved her: but who has
worshipped her with so manly a passion, so loyal a love, as Browning?
One alone indeed may be mated with him here, she who had his heart of
hearts, and who lies at rest in the old Florentine cemetery within sound
of the loved waters of Arno. Who can forget his lines in "De Gustibus,"
<a name="page58" id="page58">"Open</a> my heart and you will see, graved
inside of it, Italy."</p>

<p>It would be no difficult task to devote a volume larger than the present
one to the descriptive analysis of none but the poems inspired by Italy,
Italian personages and history, Italian Painting, Sculpture,
Architecture, and Music. From Porphyria and her lover to Pompilia and
all the direful Roman tragedy wherein she is as a moon of beauty above
conflicting savage tides of passion, what an unparalleled gallery of
portraits, what a brilliant phantasmagoria, what a movement of intensest
life!</p>

<p>It is pleasant to know of one of them, "The Italian in England," that
Browning was proud, because Mazzini told him he had read this poem to
certain of his fellow-exiles in England to show how an Englishman could
sympathise with them.</p>

<p>After leaving Russia the young poet spent the rest of his <i>Wanderjahr</i>
in Italy. Among other places he visited was Asolo, that white little
hill-town of the Veneto, whence he drew hints for "Sordello," and "Pippa
Passes," and whither he returned in the last year of his life, as with
unconscious significance he himself said, "on his way homeward."</p>

<p>In the summer of 1834, that is, when he was in his twenty-second year,
he returned to Camberwell. "Sordello" he had in some fashion begun, but
had set aside for a poem which occupied him throughout the autumn of
1834 and winter of 1835, "Paracelsus." In this period, also, he wrote
some short poems, two of them of particular significance. The first of
the series was a sonnet, which appeared above the signature 'Z' in the
<a name="page59" id="page59">August</a> number of the <i>Monthly Repository</i>
for 1834. It was never reprinted by the author, whose judgment it is impossible
not to approve as well as to respect. Browning never wrote a good sonnet, and
this earliest effort is not the most fortunate. It was in the <i>Repository</i>
also, in 1835 and 1836, that the other poems appeared, four in all.</p>

<p>The song in "Pippa Passes," beginning "A King lived long ago," was one
of these; and the lyric, "Still ailing, wind? Wilt be appeased or no?"
afterwards revised and incorporated in "James Lee," was another. But the
two which are much the most noteworthy are "Johannes Agricola" and
"Porphyria." Even more distinctively than in "Pauline," in their novel
sentiment, new method, and generally unique quality, is a new voice
audible in these two poems. They are very remarkable as the work of so
young a poet, and are interesting as showing how rapidly he had outgrown
the influence of any other of his poetic kindred. "Johannes Agricola" is
significant as being the first of those dramatic studies of warped
religiosity, of strange self-sophistication, which have afforded so much
matter for thought. In its dramatic concision, its complex psychological
significance, and its unique, if to unaccustomed ears somewhat barbaric,
poetic beauty, "Porphyria" is still more remarkable.</p>

<p>It may be of this time, though possibly some years later, that Mrs.
Bridell-Fox writes:--"I remember him as looking in often in the
evenings, having just returned from his first visit to Venice. I cannot
tell the date for certain. He was full of enthusiasm for that Queen of
Cities. He used to illustrate his glowing descriptions of its beauties,
the palaces, the sunsets, the <a name="page60" id="page60">moonrises</a>,
by a most original kind of etching. Taking up a bit of stray notepaper,
he would hold it over a lighted candle, moving the paper about gently till
it was cloudily smoked over, and then utilising the darker smears for
clouds, shadows, water, or what not, would etch with a dry pen the forms
of lights on cloud and palace, on bridge or gondola on the vague and dreamy
surface he had produced. My own passionate longing to see Venice dates from
those delightful, well-remembered evenings of my childhood."</p>

<p>"Paracelsus," begun about the close of October or early in November
1834, was published in the summer of the following year. It is a poem in
blank verse, about four times the length of "Pauline," with interspersed
songs. The author divided it into five sections of unequal length, of
which the third is the most extensive: "Paracelsus Aspires"; "Paracelsus
Attains"; "Paracelsus"; "Paracelsus Aspires"; "Paracelsus Attains." In
an interesting note, which was not reprinted in later editions of his
first acknowledged poem, the author dissuades the reader from mistaking
his performance for one of a class with which it has nothing in common,
from judging it by principles on which it was not moulded, and from
subjecting it to a standard to which it was never meant to conform. He
then explains that he has composed a dramatic poem, and not a drama in
the accepted sense; that he has not set forth the phenomena of the mind
or the passions by the operation of persons and events, or by recourse
to an external machinery of incidents to create and evolve the crisis
sought to be produced. Instead of this, he remarks, "I have ventured to
display somewhat minutely the <a name="page61" id="page61">mood</a> itself
in its rise and progress, and have suffered the agency, by which it is
influenced and determined, to be generally discernible in its effects
alone, and subordinate throughout, if not altogether excluded: and this
for a reason. I have endeavoured to write a poem, not a drama." A little
further, he states that a work like "Paracelsus" depends, for its success,
immediately upon the intelligence and sympathy of the reader: "Indeed,
were my scenes stars, it must be his co-operating fancy which, supplying
all chasms, shall connect the scattered lights into one constellation--a
Lyre or a Crown."</p>

<p>In the concluding paragraph of this note there is a point of
interest--the statement of the author's hope that the readers of
"Paracelsus" will not "be prejudiced against other productions which may
follow in a more popular, and perhaps less difficult form." From this it
might fairly be inferred that Browning had not definitively adopted his
characteristic method: that he was far from unwilling to gain the
general ear: and that he was alert to the difficulties of popularisation
of poetry written on lines similar to those of "Paracelsus." Nor would
this inference be wrong: for, as a matter of fact, the poet, immediately
upon the publication of "Paracelsus," determined to devote himself to
poetic work which should have so direct a contact with actual life that
its appeal should reach even to the most uninitiate in the mysteries and
delights of verse.</p>

<p>In his early years Browning had always a great liking for walking in the
dark. At Camberwell he was wont to carry this love to the point of
losing many a night's rest. There was, in particular, a wood near
Dulwich, whither he was wont to go. There he would walk swiftly and
<a name="page62" id="page62">eagerly</a> along the solitary and lightless
byways, finding a potent stimulus to imaginative thought in the happy
isolation thus enjoyed, with all the concurrent delights of natural things,
the wind moving like a spirit through the tree-branches, the drifting of
poignant fragrances, even in winter-tide, from herb and sappy bark,
imperceptible almost by the alertest sense in the day's manifold detachments.
At this time, too, he composed much in the open air. This he rarely, if ever,
did in later life. Not only many portions of "Paracelsus," but several scenes
in "Strafford," were enacted first in these midnight silences of the
Dulwich woodland. Here, too, as the poet once declared, he came to know
the serene beauty of dawn: for every now and again, after having read
late, or written long, he would steal quietly from the house, and walk
till the morning twilight graded to the pearl and amber of the new day.</p>

<p>As in childhood the glow of distant London had affected him to a
pleasure that was not without pain, perhaps to a pain rather that was a
fine delirium, so in his early manhood the neighbourhood of the huge
city, felt in those midnight walks of his, and apprehended more by the
transmutive shudder of reflected glare thrown fadingly upward against
the stars, than by any more direct vision or even far-borne
indeterminate hum, dominated his imagination. At that distance, in those
circumstances, humanity became more human. And with the thought, the
consciousness of this imperative kinship, arose the vague desire, the
high resolve to be no curious dilettante in novel literary experiments,
but to compel an interpretative understanding of this complex human
environment.</p>

<p><a name="page63" id="page63">Those</a> who knew the poet intimately
are aware of the loving regard he always had for those nocturnal experiences:
but perhaps few recognise how much we owe to the subtle influences of that
congenial isolation he was wont to enjoy on fortunate occasions.</p>

<p>It is not my intention--it would, obviously, be a futile one, if
entertained--to attempt an analysis or elaborate criticism of the many
poems, long and short, produced by Robert Browning. Not one volume, but
several, of this size, would have to be allotted to the adequate
performance of that end. Moreover, if readers are unable or unwilling to
be their own expositors, there are several trustworthy hand-books which
are easily procurable. Some one, I believe, has even, with unselfish
consideration for the weaker brethren, turned "Sordello" into prose--a
superfluous task, some scoffers may exclaim. Personally, I cannot but
think this craze for the exposition of poetry, this passion for
"dissecting a rainbow," is harmful to the individual as well as
humiliating to the high office of Poetry itself, and not infrequently it
is ludicrous.</p>

<p>I must be content with a few words anent the more important or
significant poems, and in due course attempt an estimate by a broad
synthesis, and not by cumulative critical analyses.</p>

<p>In the selection of Paracelsus as the hero of his first mature poem,
Browning was guided first of all by his keen sympathy with the
scientific spirit--the spirit of dauntless inquiry, of quenchless
curiosity, of a searching enthusiasm. Pietro of Abano, Giordano Bruno,
Galileo, were heroes whom he regarded with an admiration which would
have been boundless but for the wise sympathy <a name="page64" id="page64">which</a>
enabled him to apprehend and understand their weaknesses as well as their lofty
qualities. Once having come to the conclusion that Paracelsus was a
great and much maligned man, it was natural for him to wish to portray
aright the features he saw looming through the mists of legend and
history. But over and above this, he half unwittingly, half consciously,
felt the fascination of that mysticism associated with the name of the
celebrated German scientist--a mysticism, in all its various phases, of
which he is now acknowledged to be the subtlest poetic interpreter in
our language, though, profound as its attraction always was for him,
never was poet with a more exquisite balance of intellectual sanity.</p>

<p>Latest research has proved that whatsoever of a pretender Paracelsus may
have been in certain respects, he was unquestionably a man of
extraordinary powers: and, as a pioneer in a science of the first
magnitude of importance, deserving of high honour. If ever the famous
German attain a high place in the history of the modern intellectual
movement in Europe, it will be primarily due to Browning's championship.</p>

<p>But of course the extent or shallowness of Paracelsus' claim is a matter
of quite secondary interest. We are concerned with the poet's
presentment of the man--of that strange soul whom he conceived of as
having anticipated so far, and as having focussed all the vagrant
speculations of the day into one startling beam of light, now lambently
pure, now lurid with gross constituents.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref9" id="fnref9" href="#fn9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn9" id="fn9" href="#fnref9">[9]</a></span>
Paracelsus has two particular claims upon our regard. He
gave us laudanum, a discovery of incalculable blessing to mankind. And
from his fourth baptismal name, which he inherited from his father, we
have our familiar term, 'bombast.' Readers interested in the known facts
concerning the "master-mind, the thinker, the explorer, the creator,"
the forerunner of Mesmer and even of Darwin and Wallace, who began life
with the sounding appellation "Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus
ab Hohenheim," should consult Browning's own learned appendical note,
and Mr. Berdoe's interesting essay in the Browning Society Papers,
No. xlix.
</div>

<p><a name="page65" id="page65">Paracelsus</a>, his friends Festus and
his wife Michal, and Aprile, an Italian poet, are the characters who are
the personal media through which Browning's already powerful genius found
expression. The poem is, of a kind, an epic: the epic of a brave soul
striving against baffling circumstance. It is full of passages of rare
technical excellence, as well as of conceptive beauty: so full, indeed,
that the sympathetic reader of it as a drama will be too apt to overlook
its radical shortcomings, cast as it is in the dramatic mould. But it must
not be forgotten that Browning himself distinctly stated he had attempted to
write "a poem, not a drama": and in the light of this simple statement
half the objections that have been made fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Paracelsus is the protagonist: the others are merely incidental. The
poem is the soul-history of the great medical student who began life so
brave of aspect and died so miserably at Salzburg: but it is also the
history of a typical human soul, which can be read without any knowledge
of actual particulars.</p>

<p>Aprile is a projection of the poet's own poetical ideal. He speaks, but
he does not live as Festus lives, or even as Michal, who, by the way, is
interesting as being the first in the long gallery of Browning's
women--a gallery <a name="page66" id="page66">of</a> superbly-drawn
portraits, of noble and striking and always intensely human women,
unparalleled except in Shakspere. Pauline, of course, exists only as an
abstraction, and Porphyria is in no exact sense a portrait from the life.
Yet Michal can be revealed only to the sympathetic eye, for she is not
drawn, but again and again suddenly silhouetted. We see her in profile
always: but when she exclaims at the last, "I ever did believe," we feel
that she has withdrawn the veil partially hiding her fair and generous spirit.</p>

<p>To the lover of poetry "Paracelsus" will always be a Golconda. It has
lines and passages of extraordinary power, of a haunting beauty, and of
a unique and exquisite charm. It may be noted, in exemplification of
Browning's artistic range, that in the descriptive passages he paints as
well in the elaborate Pre-Raphaelite method as with a broad synthetic
touch: as in</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in3">"One old populous green wall</span><br />
      Tenanted by the ever-busy flies,<br />
      Grey crickets and shy lizards and quick spiders,<br />
      Each family of the silver-threaded moss--<br />
      Which, look through near, this way, and it appears<br />
      A stubble-field or a cane-brake, a marsh<br />
      Of bulrush whitening in the sun...."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But oftener he prefers the more succinct method of
landscape-painting, the broadest impressionism: as in</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Past the high rocks the haunts of doves, the mounds<br />
      Of red earth from whose sides strange trees grow out,<br />
      Past tracks of milk-white minute blinding sand."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And where in modern poetry is there a superber union of the
scientific and the poetic vision than in this <a name="page67" id="page67">magnificent</a>
passage--the quintessence of the poet's conception of the rapture of life:--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="noindent">"The centre-fire heaves underneath the earth,<br />
      And the earth changes like a human face;<br />
      The molten ore bursts up among the rocks,<br />
      Winds into the stone's heart, outbranches bright<br />
      In hidden mines, spots barren river-beds,<br />
      Crumbles into fine sand where sunbeams bask--<br />
      God joys therein. The wroth sea's waves are edged<br />
      With foam, white as the bitten lip of hate,<br />
      When in the solitary waste, strange groups<br />
      Of young volcanoes come up, cyclops-like,<br />
      Staring together with their eyes on flame--<br />
      God tastes a pleasure in their uncouth pride.<br />
      Then all is still; earth is a wintry clod:<br />
      But Spring-wind, like a dancing psaltress, passes<br />
      Over its breast to waken it, rare verdure<br />
      Buds tenderly upon rough banks, between<br />
      The withered tree-rests and the cracks of frost,<br />
      Like a smile striving with a wrinkled face;<br />
      The grass grows bright, the boughs are swoln with blooms<br />
      Like chrysalids impatient for the air,<br />
      The shining dorrs are busy, beetles run<br />
      Along the furrows, ants make their ado;<br />
      Above, birds fly in merry flocks, the lark<br />
      Soars up and up, shivering for very joy;<br />
      Afar the ocean sleeps; white fishing gulls<br />
      Flit where the strand is purple with its tribe<br />
      Of nested limpets; savage creatures seek<br />
      Their loves in wood and plain--and God renews<br />
      His ancient rapture."</p>
</div>

<p>In these lines, particularly in their close, is manifest the influence
of the noble Hebraic poetry. It must have been at this period that
Browning conned over and over with an exultant delight the simple but
lordly diction of Isaiah and the other prophets, preferring this
<a name="page68" id="page68">Biblical</a> poetry to that even of his beloved
Greeks. There is an anecdote of his walking across a public park (I am told
Richmond, but more probably it was Wimbledon Common) with his hat in his
left hand and his right waving to and fro declamatorily, while the wind
blew his hair around his head like a nimbus: so rapt in his ecstasy over
the solemn sweep of the Biblical music that he did not observe a small
following consisting of several eager children, expectant of thrilling
stump-oratory. He was just the man, however, to accept an anti-climax
genially, and to dismiss his disappointed auditory with something more
tangible than an address.</p>

<p>The poet-precursor of scientific knowledge is again and again manifest:
as, for example, in</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="noindent">"Hints and previsions of which faculties<br />
      Are strewn confusedly everywhere about<br />
      The inferior natures, and all lead up higher,<br />
      All shape out dimly the superior race,<br />
      The heir of hopes too fair to turn out false,<br />
      And man appears at last."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref10" id="fnref10" href="#fn10">[10]</a></span></p>

Readers interested in Browning's inspiration from, and
treatment of, Science, should consult the excellent essay on him as "A
Scientific Poet" by Mr. Edward Berdoe, F.R.C.S., and, in particular,
compare with the originals the references given by Mr. Berdoe to the
numerous passages bearing upon Evolution and the several sciences, from
Astronomy to Physiology.</div>

<p>There are lines, again, which have a magic that cannot be defined. If it
be not felt, no sense of it can be conveyed through another's words.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Whose memories were a solace to me oft,<br />
      As mountain-baths to wild fowls in their flight."</p>
</div>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"<a name="page69" id="page69">Ask</a> the gier-eagle why she stoops at once<br />

      The silent boundless regions of the sky."</p>
</div>

<p>There is one passage, beautiful in itself, which has a pathetic
significance henceforth. Gordon, our most revered hero, was wont to
declare that nothing in all nonscriptural literature was so dear to him,
nothing had so often inspired him in moments of gloom:--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in8">"I go to prove my soul!</span><br />
      I see my way as birds their trackless way.<br />
      I shall arrive! What time, what circuit first,<br />
      I ask not: but unless God send His hail<br />
      Or blinding fireballs, sleet or stifling snow,<br />
      In some time, His good time, I shall arrive:<br />
      He guides me and the bird. In his good time."</p>
</div>

<p>As for the much misused 'Shaksperian' comparison, so often mistakenly
applied to Browning, there is nothing in "Paracelsus" in the least way
derivative. Because Shakspere is the greatest genius evolved from our
race, it does not follow that every lofty intellect, every great
objective poet, should be labelled "Shaksperian." But there is a certain
quality in poetic expression which we so specify, because the intense
humanity throbbing in it finds highest utterance in the greatest of our
poets: and there is at least one instance of such poignant speech in
"Paracelsus," worthy almost to be ranked with the last despairing cry of
Guido calling upon murdered Pompilia:--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Festus, strange secrets are let out by death<br />
      Who blabs so oft the follies of this world:<br />
      <a name="page70" id="page70">And</a> I am death's familiar, as you know.<br />
      I helped a man to die, some few weeks since,<br />
      Warped even from his go-cart to one end--<br />
      The living on princes' smiles, reflected from<br />
      A mighty herd of favourites. No mean trick<br />
      He left untried, and truly well-nigh wormed<br />
      All traces of God's finger out of him:<br />
      Then died, grown old. And just an hour before,<br />
      Having lain long with blank and soulless eyes,<br />
      He sat up suddenly, and with natural voice<br />
      Said that in spite of thick air and closed doors<br />
      God told him it was June; and he knew well<br />
      Without such telling, harebells grew in June;<br />
      And all that kings could ever give or take<br />
      Would not be precious as those blooms to him."</p>
</div>

<p>Technically, I doubt if Browning ever produced any finer long poem,
except "Pippa Passes," which is a lyrical drama, and neither exactly a
'play' nor exactly a 'poem' in the conventional usage of the terms.
Artistically, "Paracelsus" is disproportionate, and has faults,
obtrusive enough to any sensitive ear: but in the main it has a beauty
without harshness, a swiftness of thought and speech without tumultuous
pressure of ideas or stammering. It has not, in like degree, the intense
human insight of, say, "The Inn Album," but it has that charm of sequent
excellence too rarely to be found in many of Browning's later writings.
It glides onward like a steadfast stream, the thought moving with the
current it animates and controls, and throbbing eagerly beneath. When we
read certain portions of "Paracelsus," and the lovely lyrics
interspersed in it, it is difficult not to think of the poet as
sometimes, in later life, stooping like the mariner in Roscoe's
beautiful sonnet, striving to reclaim "some loved lost echo from
<a name="page71" id="page71">the</a> fleeting strand." But it is the
fleeting shore of exquisite art, not of the far-reaching shadowy capes
and promontories of "the poetic land."</p>

<p>Of the four interlusive lyrics the freer music is in the unique chant,
"Over the sea our galleys went:" a song full of melody and blithe lilt.
It is marvellously pictorial, and yet has a freedom that places it among
the most delightful of spontaneous lyrics:--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"We shouted, every man of us,<br />
      And steered right into the harbour thus,<br />
      With pomp and p&aelig;an glorious."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is, however, too long for present quotation, and
as an example of Browning's early lyrics I select rather the rich and
delicate second of these "Paracelsus" songs, one wherein the influence
of Keats is so marked, and yet where all is the poet's own:--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Heap cassia, sandal-buds and stripes<br />
     <span class="in1">  Of labdanum, and aloe-balls,</span><br />
      Smeared with dull nard an Indian wipes<br />
     <span class="in1">  From out her hair: such balsam falls</span><br />
     <span class="in1">  Down sea-side mountain pedestals,</span><br />
      From tree-tops where tired winds are fain,<br />
      Spent with the vast and howling main,<br />
      To treasure half their island-gain.</p>

     <p class="quote">"And strew faint sweetness from some old<br />
     <span class="in1">  Egyptian's fine worm-eaten shroud</span><br />
      Which breaks to dust when once unrolled;<br />
     <span class="in1">  Or shredded perfume, like a cloud</span><br />
     <span class="in1">  From closet long to quiet vowed,</span><br />
      With mothed and dropping arras hung,<br />
      Mouldering her lute and books among,<br />
      As when a queen, long dead, was young."</p>
</div>

<p><a name="page72" id="page72">With</a> this music in our ears we can
well forgive some of the prosaic commonplaces which deface
"Paracelsus"--some of those lapses from rhythmic energy to which
the poet became less and less sensitive, till he could be so deaf
to the vanishing "echo of the fleeting strand" as to sink to the level
of doggerel such as that which closes the poem called "Popularity."</p>

<p>"Paracelsus" is not a great, but it is a memorable poem: a notable
achievement, indeed, for an author of Browning's years. Well may we
exclaim with Festus, when we regard the poet in all the greatness of his
maturity--</p>

<h2><a name="page73" id="page73">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p>The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> dismissed "Paracelsus" with a half contemptuous line or
two. On the other hand, the <i>Examiner</i> acknowledged it to be a work of
unequivocal power, and predicted for its author a brilliant career. The
same critic who wrote this review contributed an article of about twenty
pages upon "Paracelsus" to the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, under the
heading, "Evidences of a New Dramatic Poetry." This article is ably
written, and remarkable for its sympathetic insight. "Mr. Browning," the
critic writes, "is a man of genius, he has in himself all the elements
of a great poet, philosophical as well as dramatic."</p>

<p>The author of this enthusiastic and important critique was John Forster.
When the <i>Examiner</i> review appeared the two young men had not met: but
the encounter, which was to be the seed of so fine a flower of
friendship, occurred before the publication of the <i>New Monthly</i>
article. Before this, however, Browning had already made one of the most
momentous acquaintanceships of his life.</p>

<p>His good friend and early critic, Mr. Fox, asked him to his house one
evening in November, a few months after the publication of "Paracelsus."
The chief guest of the occasion was Macready, then at the
<a name="page74" id="page74">height</a> of his great reputation.
Mr. Fox had paved the way for the young poet, but the moment he
entered he carried with him his best recommendation. Every one
who met Browning in those early years of his buoyant manhood seems to
have been struck by his comeliness and simple grace of manner. Macready
stated that he looked more like a poet than any man he had ever met. As
a young man he appears to have had a certain ivory delicacy of
colouring, what an old friend perhaps somewhat exaggeratedly described
to me as an almost flower-like beauty, which passed ere long into a less
girlish and more robust complexion. He appeared taller than he was, for
he was not above medium height, partly because of his rare grace of
movement, and partly from a characteristic high poise of the head when
listening intently to music or conversation. Even then he had that
expressive wave o' the hand, which in later years was as full of various
meanings as the <i>Ecco</i> of an Italian. A swift alertness pervaded him,
noticeable as much in the rapid change of expression, in the deepening
and illuming colours of his singularly expressive eyes, and in his
sensitive mouth, with the upper lip ever so swift to curve or droop in
response to the most fluctuant emotion, as in his greyhound-like
apprehension, which so often grasped the subject in its entirety before
its propounder himself realised its significance. A lady, who remembers
Browning at that time, has told me that his hair--then of a brown so
dark as to appear black--was so beautiful in its heavy sculpturesque
waves as to attract frequent notice. Another, and more subtle, personal
charm was his voice, then with a rare flute-like
<a name="page75" id="page75">tone</a>, clear, sweet, and resonant.
Afterwards, though always with precise clarity, it became merely
strong and hearty, a little too loud sometimes, and not infrequently
as that of one simulating keen immediate interest while the
attention was almost wholly detached.</p>

<p>Macready, in his Journal,<span class="fnref">
<a name="fnref11" id="fnref11" href="#fn11">[11]</a></span>
about a week later than the date of his first meeting with the poet,
wrote--"Read 'Paracelsus,' a work of great daring, starred with poetry of
thought, feeling, and diction, but occasionally obscure: the writer can
scarcely fail to be a leading spirit of his time." The tragedian's house,
whither he went at week-ends and on holidays, was at Elstree, a short
distance to the northward of Hampstead: and there he invited Browning,
among other friends, to come on the last day of December and spend New
Year's Day (1836).<span class="fnref">
<a name="fnref12" id="fnref12" href="#fn12">[12]</a></span>
When alluding, in after years, to this visit, Browning always spoke of
it as one of the red-letter days <a name="page76" id="page76">of</a> his
life. It was here he first met Forster, with whom he at once formed what
proved to be an enduring friendship; and on this occasion, also, that he
was urged by his host to write a poetic play.</p>

<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn12" id="fn12" href="#fnref12">[12]</a></span>
It was for Macready's eldest boy, William Charles, that
Browning wrote one of the most widely popular of his poems, "The Pied
Piper of Hamelin." It is said to have been an impromptu performance, and
to have been so little valued by the author that he hesitated about its
inclusion in "Bells and Pomegranates." It was inserted at the last
moment, in the third number, which was short of "copy." Some one
(anonymous, but whom I take to be Mr. Nettleship) has publicly alluded
to his possession of a rival poem (entitled, simply, "Hamelin") by
Robert Browning the elder, and of a letter which he had sent to a friend
along with the verses, in which he writes: "Before I knew that Robert
had begun the story of the 'Rats' I had contemplated a tale on the same
subject, and proceeded with it as far as you see, but, on hearing that
Robert had a similar one on hand, I desisted." This must have been in
1842, for it was in that year that the third part of <i>Bells and
Pomegranates</i> was published. In 1843, however, he finished it.
Browning's "Pied Piper" has been translated into French, Russian,
Italian, and German. The latter (or one German) version is in prose. It
was made in 1880, for a special purpose, and occupied the whole of one
number of the local paper of Hameln, which is a quaint townlet in
Hanover.
</div>

<p>Browning promised to consider the suggestion. Six weeks later, in
company with Forster, with whom he had become intimate, he called upon
Macready, to discuss the plot of a tragedy which he had pondered. He
told the tragedian how deeply he had been impressed by his performance
of "Othello," and how this had deflected his intention from a modern and
European to an Oriental and ancient theme. "Browning said that I had
<i>bit</i> him by my performance of 'Othello,' and I told him I hoped I
should make the blood come." The "blood" had come in the guise of a
drama-motive based on the crucial period in the career of Narses, the
eunuch-general of Justinian. Macready liked the suggestion, though he
demurred to one or two points in the outline: and before Browning left
he eagerly pressed him to "go on with 'Narses.'" But whether Browning
mistrusted his own interest in the theme, or was dubious as to the
success with which Macready would realise his conception, or as to the
reception a play of such a nature would win from an auditory no longer
reverent of high dramatic ideals, he gave up the idea. Some three
<a name="page77" id="page77">months</a> later (May 26th) he enjoyed another
eventful evening. It was the night of the first performance of Talfourd's
"Ion," and he was among the personal friends of Macready who were invited
to the supper at Talfourd's rooms. After the fall of the curtain, Browning,
Forster, and other friends sought the tragedian and congratulated him upon
the success both of the play and of his impersonation of the chief
character. They then adjourned to the house of the author of "Ion." To
his surprise and gratification Browning found himself placed next but
one to his host, and immediately opposite Macready, who sat between two
gentlemen, one calm as a summer evening, and the other with a
tempestuous youth dominating his sixty years, whom the young poet at
once recognised as Wordsworth and Walter Savage Landor. Every one was in
good spirits: the host perhaps most of all, who was celebrating his
birthday as well as the success of "Ion." Possibly Macready was the only
person who felt at all bored--unless it was Landor--for Wordsworth was
not, at such a function, an entertaining conversationalist. There is
much significance in the succinct entry in Macready's journal concerning
the Lake-poet--"Wordsworth, who pinned me." ... When Talfourd rose to
propose the toast of "The Poets of England" every one probably expected
that Wordsworth would be named to respond. But with a kindly grace the
host, after flattering remarks upon the two great men then honouring him
by sitting at his table, coupled his toast with the name of the youngest
of the poets of England--"Mr. Robert Browning, the author of
'Paracelsus.'" It was a very proud moment for Browning, singled out
among that brilliant <a name="page78" id="page78">company</a>: and it is
pleasant to know, on the authority of Miss Mitford, who was present, that
"he performed his task with grace and modesty," looking, the amiable lady
adds, even younger than he was. Perhaps, however, he was prouder still
when Wordsworth leaned across the table, and with stately affability said,
"I am proud to drink your health, Mr. Browning:" when Landor, also, with
a superbly indifferent and yet kindly smile, also raised his glass to his
lips in courteous greeting.</p>

<p>Of Wordsworth Browning saw not a little in the ensuing few years, for on
the rare visits the elderly poet paid to London, Talfourd never failed
to ask the author of "Paracelsus," for whom he had a sincere admiration,
to meet the great man. It was not in the nature of things that the two
poets could become friends, but though the younger was sometimes annoyed
by the elder's pooh-poohing his republican sympathies, and
contemptuously waiving aside as a mere nobody no less an individual than
Shelley, he never failed of respect and even reverence. With what
tenderness and dignity he has commemorated the great poet's falling away
from his early ideals, may be seen in "The Lost Leader," one of the most
popular of Browning's short poems, and likely to remain so. For several
reasons, however, it is best as well as right that Wordsworth should not
be more than merely nominally identified with the Lost Leader. Browning
was always imperative upon this point.</p>

<p>Towards Landor, on the other hand, he entertained a sentiment of genuine
affection, coupled with a profound sympathy and admiration: a sentiment
duly reciprocated. The care of the younger for the elder, in the old
<a name="page79" id="page79">age</a> of the latter, is one of the most
beautiful incidents in a beautiful life.</p>

<p>But the evening was not to pass without another memorable incident, one
to which we owe "Strafford," and probably "A Blot on the 'Scutcheon."
Just as the young poet, flushed with the triumphant pleasure of the
evening, was about to leave, Macready arrested him by a friendly grip of
the arm. In unmistakable earnestness he asked Browning to write him a
play. With a simplicity equal to the occasion, the poet contented
himself with replying, "Shall it be historical and English? What do you
say to a drama on Strafford?"</p>

<p>Macready was pleased with the idea, and hopeful that his friend would be
more successful with the English statesman than with the eunuch Narses.</p>

<p>A few months elapsed before the poet, who had set aside the long work
upon which he was engaged ("Sordello"), called upon Macready with the
manuscript of "Strafford." The latter hoped much from it. In March the
MS. was ready. About the end of the month Macready took it to Covent
Garden Theatre, and read it to Mr. Osbaldiston, "who caught at it with
avidity, and agreed to produce it without delay."</p>

<p>It was an eventful first of May--an eventful twelvemonth, indeed, for it
was the initial year of the Victorian era, notable, too, as that wherein
the Electric Telegraph was established, and, in letters, wherein a new
dramatic literature had its origin. For "Strafford," already significant
of a novel movement, and destined, it seems to me, to be still more
significant in that great dramatic period towards which we are fast
converging, was not less important to the Drama in
<a name="page80" id="page80">England</a>, as a new departure in method
and radically indicative of a fresh standpoint, than
"Hernani" was in France. But in literary history the day itself is
doubly memorable, for in the forenoon Carlyle gave the first of his
lectures in London. The play was a success, despite the shamefully
inadequate acting of some of those entrusted with important parts. There
was once, perhaps there were more occasions than one, where success
poised like the soul of a Mohammedan on the invisible thread leading to
Paradise, but on either side of which lies perdition. There was none to
cry <i>Timbul</i> save Macready, except Miss Helen Faucit, who gained a
brilliant triumph as Lady Carlisle. The part of Charles I. was enacted
so execrably that damnation for all was again and again within
measurable distance. "The Younger Vane" ranted so that a hiss, like an
embodied scorn, vibrated on vagrant wings throughout the house. There
was not even any extraneous aid to a fortunate impression. The house was
in ill repair: the seats dusty, the "scenery" commonplace and sometimes
noticeably inappropriate, the costumes and accessories almost sordid.
But in the face of all this, a triumph was secured. For a brief while
Macready believed that the star of regeneration had arisen.
Unfortunately 'twas, in the words of a contemporary dramatic poet, "a
rising sorrow splendidly forlorn." The financial condition of Covent
Garden Theatre was so ruinous that not even the most successful play
could have restored its doomed fortunes.</p>

<p>After the fifth night one of the leading actors, having received a
better offer elsewhere, suddenly withdrew.</p>

<p><a name="page81" id="page81">This</a> was the last straw. A collapse
forthwith occurred. In the scramble for shares in the few remaining funds
every one gained something, except the author, who was to have received
&pound;12 for each performance for the first twenty-five nights, and,
&pound;10 each for ten nights further. This disaster was a deep
disappointment to Browning, and a by no means transitory one, for
three or four years later he wrote (<i>Advt.</i> of "Bells and Pomegranates"):
"Two or three years ago I wrote a play, about which the chief matter I
much care to recollect at present is, that a pitful of good-natured
people applauded it. Ever since, I have been desirous of doing something
in the same way that should better reward their attention." But, except
in so far as its abrupt declension from the stage hurt its author in the
eyes of the critics, and possibly in those of theatrical managers,
"Strafford" was certainly no failure. It has the elements of a great
acting play. Everything, even the language (and here was a stumbling-block
with most of the critics and criticasters), was subordinated to dramatic
exigencies: though the subordination was in conformity with a novel
shaping method. "Strafford" was not, however, allowed to remain unknown
to those who had been unable to visit Covent Garden Theatre.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref13" id="fnref13" href="#fn13">[13]</a></span>
Browning's name had <a name="page82" id="page82">quite</a> sufficient
literary repute to justify a publisher in risking the issue of a drama
by him; one, at any rate, that had the advantage of association with
Macready's name. The Longmans issued it, and the author had the pleasure
of knowing that his third poetic work was not produced at the expense of
a relative, but at that of the publishers. It had but an indifferent
reception, however.</p>

"It is time to deny a statement that has been repeated <i>ad
nauseam</i> in every notice that professes to give an account of Mr.
Browning's career. Whatever is said or not said, it is always that his
plays have 'failed' on the stage. In point of fact, the three plays
which he has brought out have all succeeded, and have owed it to
fortuitous circumstances that their tenure on the boards has been
comparatively short."--E.W. GOSSE, in article in <i>The Century
Magazine.</i>
</div>

<p>Most people who saw the performance of "Strafford" given in 1886, under
the auspices of the Browning Society, were surprised as well as
impressed: for few, apparently, had realised from perusal the power of
the play as made manifest when acted. The secret of this is that the
drama, when privily read, seems hard if not heavy in its diction, and to
be so inornate, though by no means correspondingly simple, as to render
any comparison between it and the dramatic work of Shakspere out of the
question. But when acted, the artistry of the play is revealed. Its
intense naturalness is due in great part to the stern concision of the
lines, where no word is wasted, where every sentence is fraught with the
utmost it can convey. The outlines which disturbed us by their vagueness
become more clear: in a word, we all see in enactment what only a few of
us can discern in perusal. The play has its faults, but scarcely those
of language, where the diction is noble and rhythmic, because it is, so
to speak, the genuine rind of the fruit it envelops. But there are
dramatic faults--primarily, in the extreme economy of the author in the
presentment of his <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, who are embodied
abstractions--monomaniacs of ideas, as some one has said of Hugo's
personages--rather than men as we are, with manifold complexities in
endless friction or fusion. <a name="page83" id="page83">One</a> cardinal
fault is the lack of humour, which to my mind is the paramount objection
to its popular acceptance. Another, is the misproportionate length of
some of the speeches. Once again, there is, as in the greater portion
of Browning's longer poems and dramas, a baneful equality of emphasis.
The conception of Charles I. is not only obviously weak, but strangely
prejudiced adversely for so keen an analyst of the soul as Browning.
For what a fellow-dramatist calls this "Sunset Shadow of a King," no
man or woman could abase every hope and energy. Shakspere would never
have committed the crucial mistake of making Charles the despicable
deformity he is in Browning's drama. Strafford himself disappears too
soon: in the fourth act there is the vacuum abhorred of dramatic propriety.</p>

<p>When he again comes on the scene, the charm is partly broken. But withal
the play is one of remarkable vigour and beauty. It seems to me that too
much has been written against it on the score of its metrical rudeness.
The lines are beat out by a hammer, but in the process they are wrought
clear of all needless alloy. To urge, as has been lately urged, that it
lacks all human touch and is a mere intellectual fanfaronade, and that
there is not once a line of poignant insight, is altogether uncritical.
Readers of this mind must have forgotten or be indifferent to those
lines, for example, where the wretched Charles stammeringly excuses
himself to his loyal minister for his death-warrant, crying out that it
was wrung from him, and begging Strafford not to curse him: or, again,
that wonderfully significant line, so full of a too tardy knowledge and
of concentrated scorn, where Strafford first begs the king to "be good
to his <a name="page84" id="page84">children</a>," and then, with a
contempt that is almost sublime, implores, "Stay, sir, do not promise,
do not swear!" The whole of the second scene in the fifth act is pure
genius. The reader, or spectator, knows by this time that all hope
is over: that Strafford, though all unaware, is betrayed and undone.
It is a subtle dramatic ruse, that of Browning's representing him
sitting in his apartment in the Tower with his young children,
William and Anne, blithely singing.</p>

<p>Can one read and ever forget the lines giving the gay Italian rhyme,
with the boy's picturesquely childish prose-accompaniment? Strafford is
seated, weary and distraught:--</p>

<p><a name="page85" id="page85">To</a> me this children's-song and the
fleeting and now plaintive echo of it, as "Voices from
Within"--"<i>Verso la sera, Di Primavera</i>"--in the terrible
scene where Strafford learns his doom, is only to be paralleled
by the song of Mariana in "Measure for Measure," wherein, likewise, is
abduced in one thrilling poignant strain the quintessential part of the
tense life of the whole play.</p>

<p>So much has been written concerning the dramas of Robert
Browning--though indeed there is still room for a volume of careful
criticism, dealing solely with this theme--that I have the less regret
in having so inadequately to pass in review works of such poetic
magnitude as those enumerated above.</p>

<p>But it would be impossible, in so small a book as this, to examine them
in detail without incurring a just charge of misproportion. The
greatness and the shortcomings of the dramas and dramatic poems must be
noted as succinctly as practicable; and I have dwelt more liberally upon
"Pauline," "Paracelsus," and "Strafford," partly because (certainly
without more than one exception, "Sordello") these are the three least
read of Browning's poems, partly because they indicate the sweep and
reach of his first orient eagle-flight through new morning-skies, and
mainly because in them we already find Browning at his best and at his
weakest, because in them we hear not only the rush of his sunlit
pinions, but also the low earthward surge of dullard wings.</p>

<p>Browning is foreshadowed in his earliest writings, as perhaps no other
poet has been to like extent. In the "Venus and Adonis," and the "Rape
of Lucrece," we have but the dimmest foreview of the author of "Hamlet,"
"Othello," and "Macbeth"; had <a name="page86" id="page86">Shakspere</a>
died prematurely none could have predicted, from the exquisite blossoms
of his adolescence, the immortal fruit of his maturity. But, in
Browning's three earliest works, we clearly discern him, as the
sculptor of Melos provisioned his Venus in the rough-hewn block.</p>

<p>Thenceforth, to change the imagery, he developed rapidly upon the same
lines, or doubled upon himself in intricate revolutions; but already his
line of life, his poetic parallel, was definitely established.</p>

<p>In the consideration of Browning's dramas it is needful to be sure of
one's vantage for judgment. The first step towards this assurance is the
ablation of the chronic Shaksperian comparison. Primarily, the shaping
spirit of the time wrought Shakspere and Browning to radically divergent
methods of expression, but each to a method in profound harmony with the
dominant sentiment of the age in which he lived. Above all others, the
Elizabethan era was rich in romantic adventure, of the mind as well as
of the body, and above all others, save that of the Renaissance in
Italy, animated by a passionate curiosity. So, too, supremely, the
Victorian era has been prolific of novel and vast Titanic struggles of
the human spirit to reach those Gates of Truth whose lowest steps are
the scarce discernible stars and furthest suns we scan, by piling Ossas
of searching speculation upon Pelions of hardly-won positive knowledge.
The highest exemplar of the former is Shakspere, Browning the
profoundest interpreter of the latter. To achieve supremacy the one had
to create a throbbing actuality, a world of keenest living, of acts and
intervolved situations and episodes: the other to fashion a mentality so
passionately alive that <a name="page87" id="page87">its</a> manifold
phases should have all the reality of concrete individualities. The one
reveals individual life to us by the play of circumstance, the interaction
of events, the correlative eduction of personal characteristics: the other
by his apprehension of that quintessential movement or mood or phase
wherein the soul is transitorily visible on its lonely pinnacle of light.
The elder poet reveals life to us by the sheer vividness of his own
vision: the younger, by a newer, a less picturesque but more scientific
abduction, compels the complex rayings of each soul-star to a singular
simplicity, as by the spectrum analysis. The one, again, fulfils his aim
by a broad synthesis based upon the vivid observance and selection of vital
details: the other by an extraordinary acute psychic analysis. In a
word, Shakspere works as with the clay of human action: Browning as with
the clay of human thought.</p>

<p>As for the difference in value of the two methods it is useless to
dogmatise. The psychic portraiture produced by either is valuable only
so far as it is convincingly true.</p>

<p>The profoundest insight cannot reach deeper than its own possibilities
of depth. The physiognomy of the soul is never visible in its entirety,
barely ever even its profile. The utmost we can expect to reproduce,
perhaps even to perceive in the most quintessential moment, is a
partially faithful, partially deceptive silhouette. As no human being
has ever seen his or her own soul, in all its rounded completeness of
good and evil, of strength and weakness, of what is temporal and
perishable and what is germinal and essential, how can we expect even
the subtlest analyst to adequately depict other souls
<a name="page88" id="page88">than</a> his own. It is Browning's
high distinction that he has this soul-depictive faculty--restricted
as even in his instance it perforce is--to an extent unsurpassed by
any other poet, ancient or modern. As a sympathetic critic has remarked,
"His stage is not the visible phenomenal England (or elsewhere) of
history; it is a point in the spiritual universe, where naked souls
meet and wrestle, as they play the great game of life, for counters,
the true value of which can only be realised in the bullion of a higher
life than this." No doubt there is "a certain crudeness in the manner
in which these naked souls are presented," not only in "Strafford" but
elsewhere in the plays. Browning markedly has the defects of his qualities.</p>

<p>As part of his method, it should be noted that his real trust is upon
monologue rather than upon dialogue. To one who works from within
outward--in contradistinction to the Shaksperian method of striving to
win from outward forms "the passion and the life whose fountains are
within"--the propriety of this dramatic means can scarce be gainsaid.
The swift complicated mental machinery can thus be exhibited infinitely
more coherently and comprehensibly than by the most electric succinct
dialogue. Again and again Browning has nigh foundered in the morass of
monologue, but, broadly speaking, he transcends in this dramatic method.</p>

<p>At the same time, none must take it for granted that the author of the
"Blot on the 'Scutchcon," "Luria," "In a Balcony," is not dramatic in
even the most conventional sense. Above all, indeed--as Mr. Walter Pater
has said--his is the poetry of situations. In each <a name="page89" id="page89">of</a>
the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, one of the leading characteristics
is loyalty to a dominant ideal. In Strafford's case it is that of unswerving
devotion to the King: in Mildred's and in Thorold's, in the "Blot on the
'Scutcheon," it is that of subservience respectively to conventional
morality and family pride (Lord Tresham, it may be added, is the most
hopelessly monomaniacal of all Browning's "monomaniacs"): in Valence's, in
"Colombe's Birthday," to chivalric love: in Charles, in "King Victor and
King Charles," to kingly and filial duty: in Anael's and Djabal's, in
"The Return of the Druses," respectively to religion and unscrupulous
ambition modified by patriotism: in Chiappino's, in "A Soul's Tragedy,"
to purely sordid ambition: in Luria's, to noble steadfastness: and in
Constance's, in "In a Balcony," to self-denial. Of these plays, "The
Return of the Druses" seems to me the most picturesque, "Luria" the most
noble and dignified, and "In a Balcony" the most potentially a great
dramatic success. The last is in a sense a fragment, but, though the
integer of a great unaccomplished drama, is as complete in itself as the
Funeral March in Beethoven's <i>Eroica</i> Symphony. The "Blot on the
'Scutcheon" has the radical fault characteristic of writers of
sensational fiction, a too promiscuous "clearing the ground" by syncope
and suicide. Another is the juvenility of Mildred:--a serious infraction
of dramatic law, where the mere tampering with history, as in the
circumstances of King Victor's death in the earlier play, is at least
excusable by high precedent. More disastrous, poetically, is the ruinous
banality of Mildred's anticlimax when, after her brother reveals himself
as her lover's murderer, she, like the <a name="page90" id="page90">typical</a>
young <i>Miss Anglaise</i> of certain French novelists, betrays her incapacity
for true passion by exclaiming, in effect, "What, you've murdered my lover!
Well, tell me all. Pardon? Oh, well, I pardon you: at least I <i>think</i>
I do. Thorold, my dear brother, how very wretched you must be!"</p>

<p>I am unaware if this anticlimax has been pointed out by any one, but
surely it is one of the most appalling lapses of genius which could be
indicated. Even the beautiful song in the third scene of the first act,
"There's a woman like a dew-drop, she's so purer than the purest," is,
in the circumstances, nearly over the verge which divides the sublime
from the ridiculous. No wonder that, on the night the play was first
acted, Mertoun's song, as he clambered to his mistress's window, caused
a sceptical laugh to ripple lightly among the tolerant auditory. It is
with diffidence I take so radically distinct a standpoint from that of
Dickens, who declared he knew no love like that of Mildred and Mertoun,
no passion like it, no moulding of a splendid thing after its
conception, like it; who, further, at a later date, affirmed that he
would rather have written this play than any work of modern times: nor
with less reluctance, that I find myself at variance with Mr. Skelton,
who speaks of the drama as "one of the most perfectly conceived and
perfectly executed tragedies in the language." In the instance of Luria,
that second Othello, suicide has all the impressiveness of a plenary act
of absolution: the death of Anael seems as inevitable as the flash of
lightning after the concussion of thunder-clouds. But Thorold's suicide
is mere weakness, scarce a perverted courage; and Mildred's broken heart
was an ill not <a name="page91" id="page91">beyond</a> the healing of a
morally robust physician. "Colombe's Birthday" has a certain remoteness
of interest, really due to the reader's more or less acute perception of
the radical divergence, for all Valence's greatness of mind and spirit,
between the fair young Duchess and her chosen lover: a circumstance which
must surely stand in the way of its popularity. Though "A Soul's Tragedy"
has the saving quality of humour, it is of too grim a kind to be
provocative of laughter.</p>

<p>In each of these plays<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref14" id="fnref14" href="#fn14">[14]</a></span>
the lover of Browning will recall passage after passage of superbly
dramatic effect. But supreme in his remembrance will be the wonderful
scene in "The Return of the Druses," where the Prefect, drawing a breath
of relief, is almost simultaneously assassinated; and that where Anael,
with every nerve at tension in her fierce religious resolve, with a
poignant, life-surrendering cry, hails Djabal as <i>Hakeem</i>--as
Divine--and therewith falls dead at his feet. Nor will he forget that
where, in the "Blot on the 'Scutcheon," Mildred, with a dry sob in her
throat, stammeringly utters--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in4">"I--I--was so young!</span><br />
      Besides I loved him, Thorold--and I had<br />
      No mother; God forgot me: so I fell----"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or that where, "at end of the disastrous day," Luria
takes the phial of poison from his breast, muttering--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Strange! This is all I brought from my own land<br />

</div>

<p><a name="page92" id="page92">Before</a> passing on from these eight
plays to Browning's most imperishable because most nearly immaculate
dramatic poem, "Pippa Passes," and to "Sordello," that colossal derelict
upon the ocean of poetry, I should like--out of an embarrassing quantity
of alluring details--to remind the reader of two secondary matters of
interest pertinent to the present theme. One is that the song in "A Blot
on the 'Scutcheon," "There's a woman like a dew-drop," written several
years before the author's meeting with Elizabeth Barrett, is so closely
in the style of "Lady Geraldine's Courtship," and other ballads by the
sweet singer who afterwards became a partner in the loveliest marriage
of which we have record in literary history, that, even were there nothing
to substantiate the fact, it were fair to infer that Mertoun's song to
Mildred was the electric touch which compelled to its metric shape one
of Mrs. Browning's best-known poems.</p>

<p>The further interest lies in the lordly acknowledgment of the dedication
to him of "Luria," which Landor sent to Browning--lines pregnant with
the stateliest music of his old age:--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Shakespeare is not our poet but the world's,<br />
      Therefore on him no speech! and brief for thee,<br />
      Browning! Since Chaucer was alive and hale<br />
      No man has walked along our roads with step<br />
      So active, so enquiring eye, or tongue<br />
      So varied in discourse. But warmer climes<br />

<hr class="long" />

<h2><a name="page93" id="page93">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p>In my allusion to "Pippa Passes," towards the close of the preceding
chapter, as the most imperishable because the most nearly immaculate of
Browning's dramatic poems, I would not have it understood that its
pre-eminence is considered from the standpoint of technical achievement,
of art, merely. It seems to me, like all simple and beautiful things,
profound enough for the searching plummet of the most curious explorer
of the depths of life. It can be read, re-read, learned by heart, and
the more it is known the wider and more alluring are the avenues of
imaginative thought which it discloses. It has, more than any other long
composition by its author, that quality of symmetry, that <i>symmetria
prisca</i> recorded of Leonardo da Vinci in the Latin epitaph of Platino
Piatto; and, as might be expected, its mental basis, what Rossetti
called fundamental brain-work, is as luminous, depth within depth, as
the morning air. By its side, the more obviously "profound" poems,
Bishop Blougram and the rest, are mere skilled dialectics.</p>

<p>The art that is most profound and most touching must ever be the
simplest. Whenever &AElig;schylus, Dante, Shakspere, Milton, are at white heat
they require no <a name="page94" id="page94">exposition</a>, but meditation
only--the meditation akin to the sentiment of little children who listen,
intent upon every syllable, and passionately eager of soul, to hearth-side
tragedies. The play of genius is like the movement of the sea. It has its
solemn rhythm: its joy, irradiate of the sun; its melancholy, in the patient
moonlight: its surge and turbulence under passing tempests: below all, the
deep oceanic music. There are, of course, many to whom the sea is but a
waste of water, at best useful as a highway and as the nursery of the
winds and rains. For them there is no hint "of the incommunicable dream"
in the curve of the rising wave, no murmur of the oceanic undertone in the
short leaping sounds, invisible things that laugh and clap their hands
for joy and are no more. To them it is but a desert: obscure,
imponderable, a weariness. The "profundity" of Browning, so dear a claim
in the eyes of the poet's fanatical admirers, exists, in their sense,
only in his inferior work. There is more profound insight in Blake's
Song of Innocence, "Piping down the valleys wild," or in Wordsworth's
line, "Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears," or in Keats'
single verse, "There is a budding morrow in midnight," or in this
quatrain on Poetry, by a young living poet--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"She comes like the husht beauty of the night,<br />
     <span class="in1">But sees too deep for laughter;</span><br />
      Her touch is a vibration and a light<br />
     <span class="in1">From worlds before and after--"</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">there is more "profundity" in any of these than in
libraries of "Sludge the Medium" literature. Mere hard thinking does not
involve profundity, any more <a name="page95" id="page95">than</a> neurotic
excitation involves spiritual ecstasy. <i>De profundis,</i> indeed, must
the poet come: there must the deep rhythm of life have electrified his
"volatile essence" to a living rhythmic joy. In this deep sense, and this
only, the poet is born, not made. He may learn to fashion anew that which
he hath seen: the depth of his insight depends upon the depth of his
spiritual heritage. If wonder dwell not in his eyes and soul there can
be no "far ken" for him. Here it seems apt to point out that Browning
was the first writer of our day to indicate this transmutive, this
inspired and inspiring wonder-spirit, which is the deepest motor in the
evolution of our modern poetry. Characteristically, he puts his utterance
into the mouth of a dreamy German student, the shadowy Schramm who is but
metaphysics embodied, metaphysics finding apt expression in tobacco-smoke:
"Keep but ever looking, whether with the body's eye or the mind's, and you
will soon find something to look on! Has a man done wondering at women?--there
follow men, dead and alive, to wonder at. Has he done wondering at
men?--there's God to wonder at: and the faculty of wonder may be, at the
same time, old and tired enough with respect to its first object, and
yet young and fresh sufficiently, so far as concerns its novel one."</p>

<p>This wonder is akin to that 'insanity' of the poet which is but
impassioned sanity. Plato sums the matter when he says, "He who, having
no touch of the Muse's madness in his soul, comes to the door and thinks
he will get into the temple by the help of Art--he, I say, and his
poetry, are not admitted."</p>

<p>In that same wood beyond Dulwich to which allusion
<a name="page96" id="page96">has</a> already been made, the germinal
motive of "Pippa Passes" flashed upon the poet. No wonder this resort
was for long one of his sacred places, and that he lamented its
disappearance as fervently as Ruskin bewailed the encroachment of the
ocean of bricks and mortar upon the wooded privacies of Denmark Hill.</p>

<p>Save for a couple of brief visits abroad, Browning spent the years,
between his first appearance as a dramatic writer and his marriage, in
London and the neighbourhood. Occasionally he took long walks into the
country. One particular pleasure was to lie beside a hedge, or deep in
meadow-grasses, or under a tree, as circumstances and the mood
concurred, and there to give himself up so absolutely to the life of the
moment that even the shy birds would alight close by, and sometimes
venturesomely poise themselves on suspicious wings for a brief space
upon his recumbent body. I have heard him say that his faculty of
observation at that time would not have appeared despicable to a
Seminole or an Iroquois: he saw and watched everything, the bird on the
wing, the snail dragging its shell up the pendulous woodbine, the bee
adding to his golden treasure as he swung in the bells of the campanula,
the green fly darting hither and thither like an animated seedling, the
spider weaving her gossamer from twig to twig, the woodpecker heedfully
scrutinising the lichen on the gnarled oak-hole, the passage of the wind
through leaves or across grass, the motions and shadows of the clouds,
and so forth. These were his golden holidays. Much of the rest of his
time, when not passed in his room in his father's house, where he wrote
his dramas and <a name="page97" id="page97">early</a> poems, and studied
for hours daily, was spent in the Library of the British Museum, in an
endless curiosity into the more or less unbeaten tracks of literature.
These London experiences were varied by whole days spent at the National
Gallery, and in communion with kindred spirits. At one time he had rooms,
or rather a room, in the immediate neighbourhood of the Strand, whither
he could go when he wished to be in town continuously for a time, or when
he had any social or theatrical engagement.</p>

<p>Browning's life at this period was distraught by more than one episode
of the heart. It would be strange were it otherwise. He had in no
ordinary degree a rich and sensuous nature, and his responsiveness was
so quick that the barriers of prudence were apt to be as shadowy to him
as to the author of "The Witch of Atlas." But he was the earnest student
for the most part, and, above all, the poet. His other pleasure, in his
happy vagrant days, was to join company with any tramps, gipsies, or
other wayfarers, and in good fellowship gain much knowledge of life that
was useful at a later time. Rustic entertainments, particularly
peripatetic "Theatres Royal," had a singular fascination for him, as for
that matter had rustic oratory, whether of the alehouse or the pulpit.
At one period he took the keenest interest in sectaries of all kinds:
and often he incurred a gentle reproof from his mother because of his
nomad propensities in search of "<i>pastors</i> new." There was even a time
when he seriously deliberated whether he should not combine literature
and religious ministry, as Faraday combined evangelical fervour with
scientific enthusiasm. "'Twas a girl with eyes like two dreams of night"
that <a name="page98" id="page98">saved</a> him from himself, and
defrauded the Church Independent of a stalwart orator.</p>

<p>It was, as already stated, while he strolled through Dulwich Wood one
day that the thought occurred to him which was to find development and
expression in "Pippa Passes." "The image flashed upon him," writes his
intimate friend, Mrs. Sutherland Orr, "of some one walking thus alone
through life; one apparently too obscure to leave a trace of his or her
passage, yet exercising a lasting though unconscious influence at every
step of it; and the image shaped itself into the little silk-winder of
Asolo, Felippa or Pippa."</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me a radical mistake to include "Pippa Passes"
among Browning's dramas. Not only is it absolutely unactable, but
essentially undramatic in the conventional sense. True dramatic writing
concerns itself fundamentally with the apt conjunction of events, and
the more nearly it approximates to the verity of life the more likely is
it to be of immediate appeal. There is a <i>vraie v&eacute;rit&eacute;</i> which only the
poet, evolving from dramatic concepts rather than attempting to
concentrate these in a quick, moving verisimilitude, can attempt. The
passing hither and thither of Pippa, like a beneficent Fate, a wandering
chorus from a higher amid the discordant medley of a lower world,
changing the circumstances and even the natures of certain more or less
heedless listeners by the wild free lilt of her happy song of innocence,
is of this <i>vraie v&eacute;rit&eacute;</i>. It is so obviously true, spiritually, that
it is unreal in the commonplace of ordinary life. Its very effectiveness is
too apt for the dramatist, who can ill afford to tamper further with the
indifferent banalities <a name="page99" id="page99">of</a> actual existence.
The poet, unhampered by the exigencies of dramatic realism, can safely, and
artistically, achieve an equally exact, even a higher verisimilitude, by
means which are, or should be, beyond adoption by the dramatist proper.</p>

<p>But over and above any 'nice discrimination,' "Pippa Passes" is simply a
poem, a lyrical masque with interspersed dramatic episodes, and
subsidiary interludes in prose. The suggestion recently made that it
should be acted is a wholly errant one. The finest part of it is
unrepresentable. The rest would consist merely of a series of tableaux,
with conversational accompaniment.</p>

<p>The opening scene, "the large mean airy chamber," where Pippa, the
little silk-winder from the mills at Asolo, springs from bed, on her New
Year's Day <i>festa</i>, and soliloquises as she dresses, is as true as it
is lovely when viewed through the rainbow glow of the poetic atmosphere:
but how could it succeed on the stage? It is not merely that the
monologue is too long: it is too inapt, in its poetic richness, for its
purpose. It is the poet, not Pippa, who evokes this sweet sunrise-music,
this strain of the "long blue solemn hours serenely flowing." The
dramatic poet may occupy himself with that deeper insight, and the wider
expression of it, which is properly altogether beyond the scope of the
playwright. In a word, he may irradiate his theme with the light that
never was on sea or land, nor will he thereby sacrifice aught of
essential truth: but his comrade must see to it that he is content with
the wide liberal air of the common day. The poetic alchemist may turn a
sword into pure gold: the playwright will <a name="page100" id="page100">concern</a>
himself with the due usage of the weapon as we know it, and attribute
to it no transcendent value, no miraculous properties. What is permissible
to Blake, painting Adam and Eve among embowering roses and lilies, while
the sun, moon, and stars simultaneously shine, is impermissible to the
portrait-painter or the landscapist, who has to idealise actuality to
the point only of artistic realism, and not to transmute it at the outset
from happily-perceived concrete facts to a glorified abstract concept.</p>

<p>In this opening monologue the much-admired song, "All service ranks the
same with God," is no song at all, properly, but simply a beautiful
short poem. From the dramatist's point of view, could anything be more
shaped for disaster than the second of the two stanzas?--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Say not 'a small event!' Why 'small'?<br />
      Costs it more pain than this, ye call<br />
      A 'great event,' should come to pass,<br />
      Than that? Untwine me from the mass<br />
      Of deeds which make up life, one deed<br />
      Power shall fall short in or exceed!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The whole of this lovely prologue is the production
of a dramatic poet, not of a poet writing a drama. On the other hand,
I cannot agree with what I read somewhere recently--that Sebald's song,
at the opening of the most superb dramatic writing in the whole range
of Victorian literature, is, in the circumstances, wholly inappropriate.
It seems to me entirely consistent with the character of Ottima's reckless
lover. He is akin to the gallant in one of Dumas' romances, who lingered
atop of the wall of the prison whence he was escaping in order to whistle
<a name="page101" id="page101">the</a> concluding bar of a blithe chanson
of freedom. What is, dramatically, disastrous in the instance of Mertoun
singing "There's a woman like a dewdrop," when he ought to be seeking
Mildred's presence in profound stealth and silence, is, dramatically,
electrically startling in the mouth of Sebald, among the geraniums of
the shuttered shrub-house, where he has passed the night with Ottima,
while her murdered husband lies stark in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>It must, however, be borne in mind that this thrilling dramatic effect
is fully experienced only in retrospection, or when there is knowledge
of what is to follow.</p>

<p>A conclusive objection to the drama as an actable play is that three of
the four main episodes are fragmentary. We know nothing of the fate of
Luigi: we can but surmise the future of Jules and Phen&eacute;: we know not how
or when Monsignor will see Pippa righted. Ottima and Sebald reach a
higher level in voluntary death than they ever could have done in life.</p>

<p>It is quite unnecessary, here, to dwell upon this exquisite flower of
genius in detail. Every one who knows Browning at all knows "Pippa
Passes." Its lyrics have been unsurpassed, for birdlike spontaneity and
a rare high music, by any other Victorian poet: its poetic insight is
such as no other poet than the author of "The Ring and the Book" and
"The Inn Album" can equal. Its technique, moreover, is superb. From the
outset of the tremendous episode of Ottima and Sebald, there is a note
of tragic power which is almost overwhelming. Who has not known what
Jakob Boehme calls "the shudder of a divine excitement" when Luca's
murderer replies to his paramour,</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in8"><a name="page102" id="page102">"morning?</a></span><br />
      It seems to me a night with a sun added."</p>
</div>

<p>How deep a note, again, is touched when Sebald exclaims, in allusion to
his murder of Luca, that he was so "wrought upon," though here, it may
be, there is an unconscious reminiscence of the tenser and more
culminative cry of Othello, "but being wrought, perplext in the
extreme." Still more profound a touch is that where Ottima, daring her
lover to the "one thing that must be done; you know what thing: Come in
and help to carry," says, with affected lightsomeness, "This dusty pane
might serve for looking-glass," and simultaneously exclaims, as she
throws them rejectingly from her nervous fingers, "Three, four--four
grey hairs!" then with an almost sublime coquetry of horror turns
abruptly to Sebald, saying with a voice striving vainly to be blithe--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in8">"Is it so you said</span><br />
      A plait of hair should wave across my neck?<br />
      No--this way."</p>
</div>

<p>Who has not been moved by the tragic grandeur of the verse, as well as
by the dramatic intensity of the episode of the lovers' "crowning
night"?</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote"><span class="in1">"<i>Ottima</i>.</span>

</div>

<p>Surely there is nothing in all our literature more poignantly dramatic
than this first part of "Pippa Passes." The strains which Pippa sings
here and throughout are as pathetically fresh and free as a thrush's
song in the heart of a beleaguered city, and as with the same
unconsidered magic. There is something of the mavis-note, liquid falling
tones, caught up in a moment in joyous caprice, in</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"<i>Give her but a least excuse to love me!<br />
      When--where----</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>No one of these songs, all acutely apt to the time and the occasion, has
a more overwhelming effect than that which interrupts Ottima and Sebald
at the perilous summit of their sin, beyond which lies utter darkness,
behind which is the narrow twilit backward way.</p>

</div>

<p>This sweet voice of Pippa reaches the guilty lovers, reaches Luigi in
his tower, hesitating between love and patriotic duty, reaches Jules and
Phen&eacute; when all the happiness of their unborn years trembles in the
balance, reaches the Prince of the Church just when his conscience is
sore beset by a seductive temptation, reaches one and all at a crucial
moment in the life of each. The ethical lesson of the whole poem is
summed up in</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"All service ranks the same with God--<br />
      With God, whose puppets, best and worst,<br />
      Are we: there is no last nor first,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"God's in his heaven--<br />
      All's right with the world!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">"With God there is no lust of Godhood," says Rossetti
in "Hand and Soul": <i>Und so ist der blaue Himmel grosser als jedes
Gew&ouml;lk darin, und dauerhafter dazu</i>, meditates Jean Paul: "There
can be nothing good, as we know it, nor anything evil, as we know it,
in the eye of the Omnipresent and the Omniscient," utters the Oriental
mystic.</p>

<p>It is interesting to know that many of the nature touches were
indirectly due to the poet's solitary rambles, by dawn, sundown, and
"dewy eve," in the wooded districts south of Dulwich, at Hatcham, and
upon Wimbledon Common, whither he was often wont to wander and to
<a name="page105" id="page105">ramble</a> for hours, and where he
composed one day the well-known lines upon Shelley, with many another
unrecorded impulse of song. Here, too, it was, that Carlyle, riding
for exercise, was stopped by 'a beautiful youth,' who introduced himself
as one of the philosopher's profoundest admirers.</p>

<p>It was from the Dulwich wood that, one afternoon in March, he saw a
storm glorified by a double rainbow of extraordinary beauty; a memorable
vision, recorded in an utterance of Luigi to his mother: here too that,
in autumnal dusks, he saw many a crescent moon with "notched and burning
rim." He never forgot the bygone "sunsets and great stars" he saw in
those days of his fervid youth. Browning remarked once that the romance
of his life was in his own soul; and on another occasion I heard him
smilingly add, to some one's vague assertion that in Italy only was
there any romance left, "Ah, well, I should like to include poor old
Camberwell!" Perhaps he was thinking of his lines in "Pippa Passes," of
the days when that masterpiece came ebullient from the fount of his
genius--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"May's warm slow yellow moonlit summer nights--<br />
      Gone are they, but I have them in my soul!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is all the distinction between "Pippa Passes"
and "Sordello" that there is between the Venus of Milos and a gigantic
Theban Sphinx. The latter is, it is true, proportionate in its vastness;
but the symmetry of mere bulk is not the <i>symmetria prisca</i> of ideal
sculpture. I have already alluded to "Sordello" as a derelict upon the
ocean of poetry. This, indeed, it still seems to me, notwithstanding the
well-meaning suasion of certain admirers of the
<a name="page106" id="page106">poem</a> who have hoped "I should do it
justice," thereby meaning that I should eulogise it as a masterpiece. It
is a gigantic effort, of a kind; so is the sustained throe of a
wrestling Titan. That the poem contains much which is beautiful is
undeniable, also that it is surcharged with winsome and profound
thoughts and a multitude of will-o'-the-wisp-like fancies which all
shape towards high thinking.</p>

<p>But it is monotonous as one of the enormous American inland seas to a
lover of the ocean, to whom the salt brine is as the breath of delight.
The fatal facility of the heroic couplet to lapse into diffuseness, has,
coupled with a warped anxiety for irreducible concision, been Browning's
ruin here.</p>

<p>There is one charge even yet too frequently made against "Sordello,"
that of "obscurity." Its interest may be found remote, its treatment
verbose, its intricacies puzzling to those unaccustomed to excursions
from the familiar highways of old usage, but its motive thought is not
obscure. It is a moonlit plain compared with the "<i>silva oscura</i>" of the
"Divina Commedia."</p>

<p>Surely this question of Browning's obscurity was expelled to the Limbo
of Dead Stupidities when Mr. Swinburne, in periods as resplendent as the
whirling wheels of Phoebus Apollo's chariot, wrote his famous incidental
passage in his "Essay on Chapman."</p>

<p>Too probably, in the dim disintegrating future which will reduce all our
o'ertoppling extremes, "Sordello" will be as little read as "The Faerie
Queene," and, similarly, only for the gleam of the quenchless lamps amid
its long deserted alleys and stately avenues. Sadly enough, for to poets
it will always be an unforgotten land--a continent
<a name="page107" id="page107">with</a> amaranth-haunted Vales of Tempe,
where, as Spenser says in one of the Aeclogues of "The Shepherd's Calendar,"
they will there oftentimes "sitten as drouned in dreme."</p>

<p>It has, for those who are not repelled, a charm all its own. I know of
no other poem in the language which is at once so wearisome and so
seductive. How can one explain paradoxes? There is a charm, or there is
none: that is what it amounts to, for each individual. <i>Tutti ga, i so
gusti, e mi go i mii</i>--"everybody follows his taste, and I follow mine,"
as the Venetian saying, quoted by Browning at the head of his Rawdon
Brown sonnet, has it.</p>

<p>All that need be known concerning the framework of "Sordello," and of
the real Sordello himself, will be found in the various Browning
hand-books, in Mr. Nettleship's and other dissertations, and,
particularly, in Mrs. Ball's most circumspect and able historical essay.
It is sufficient here to say that while the Sordello and Palma of the
poet are traceable in the Cunizza and the strange comet-like Sordello of
the Italian and Provençal Chronicles (who has his secure immortality, by
Dante set forth in leonine guise--<i>a guisa di leon quando si posa</i>--in
the "Purgatorio"), both these are the most shadowy of prototypes. The
Sordello of Browning is a typical poetic soul: the narrative of the
incidents in the development of this soul is adapted to the historical
setting furnished by the aforesaid Chronicles. Sordello is a far more
profound study than Aprile in "Paracelsus," in whom, however, he is
obviously foreshadowed. The radical flaw in his nature is that indicated
by Goethe of Heine, that "he had no <a name="page108" id="page108">heart</a>."
The poem is the narrative of his transcendent aspirations, and more or less
futile accomplishment.</p>

<p>It would be vain to attempt here any adequate excerption of lines of
singular beauty. Readers familiar with the poem will recall passage
after passage--among which there is probably none more widely known than
the grandiose sunset lines:--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in4">"That autumn eve was stilled:</span><br />
      A last remains of sunset dimly burned<br />
      O'er the far forests,--like a torch-flame turned<br />
      By the wind back upon its bearer's hand<br />
      In one long flare of crimson; as a brand,<br />
      The woods beneath lay black." ...</p>
</div>

<p>What haunting lines there are, every here and there--such as those of
Palma, with her golden hair like spilt sunbeams, or those on Elys, with
her</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in8">"Few fine locks</span><br />
      Coloured like honey oozed from topmost rocks<br />
      Sun-blanched the livelong summer," ...</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or these,</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in10">"Day by day</span><br />
      New pollen on the lily-petal grows,<br />
      And still more labyrinthine buds the rose----"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or, once more,</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in8">"A touch divine----</span><br />
      And the sealed eyeball owns the mystic rod;<br />
      Visibly through his garden walketh God----"</p>
</div>

<p>But, though sorely tempted, I must not quote further, save only the
concluding lines of the unparalleled and impassioned address to Dante:--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in6">
     "<a name="page109" id="page109">Dante</a>, pacer of the shore</span><br />
      Where glutted hell disgorgeth filthiest gloom,<br />
      Unbitten by its whirring sulphur-spume,<br />
      Or whence the grieved and obscure waters slope<br />
      Into a darkness quieted by hope;<br />
      Plucker of amaranths grown beneath God's eye<br />
      In gracious twilights where his chosen lie----"</p>
</div>

<p>It is a fair land, for those who have lingered in its byways: but, alas,
a troubled tide of strange metres, of desperate rhythms, of wild
conjunctions, of panic-stricken collocations, oftentimes overwhelms it.
"Sordello" grew under the poet's fashioning till, like the magic vapour
of the Arabian wizard, it passed beyond his control, "voluminously
vast."</p>

<p>It is not the truest admirers of what is good in it who will refuse to
smile at the miseries of conscientious but baffled readers. Who can fail
to sympathise with Douglas Jerrold when, slowly convalescent from a
serious illness, he found among some new books sent him by a friend a
copy of "Sordello." Thomas Powell, writing in 1849, has chronicled the
episode. A few lines, he says, put Jerrold in a state of alarm. Sentence
after sentence brought no consecutive thought to his brain. At last the
idea occurred to him that in his illness his mental faculties had been
wrecked. The perspiration rolled from his forehead, and smiting his head
he sank back on the sofa, crying, "O God, I <i>am</i> an idiot!" A little
later, adds Powell, when Jerrold's wife and sister entered, he thrust
"Sordello" into their hands, demanding what they thought of it. He
watched them intently while they read. When at last Mrs. Jerrold
remarked, "I don't understand what <a name="page110" id="page110">this</a>
man means; it is gibberish," her delighted husband gave a sigh of relief
and exclaimed, "Thank God, I am <i>not</i> an idiot!"</p>

<p>Many friends of Browning will remember his recounting this incident
almost in these very words, and his enjoyment therein: though he would
never admit justification for such puzzlement.</p>

<p>But more illustrious personages than Douglas Jerrold were puzzled by the
poem. Lord Tennyson manfully tackled it, but he is reported to have
admitted in bitterness of spirit: "There were only two lines in it that
I understood, and they were both lies; they were the opening and closing
lines, '<i>Who will may hear Sordello's story told</i>,' and '<i>Who would
has heard Sordello's story told!</i>'" Carlyle was equally candid: "My
wife," he writes, "has read through 'Sordello' without being able to make
out whether 'Sordello' was a man, or a city, or a book."</p>

<p>In an article on this poem, in a French magazine, M. Odysse Barot quotes
a passage where the poet says "God gave man two faculties"--and adds, "I
wish while He was about it (<i>pendant qu'il &eacute;tait en train</i>) God had
supplied another--viz., the power of understanding Mr. Browning."</p>

<p>And who does not remember the sad experience of generous and delightful
Gilead P. Beck, in "The Golden Butterfly": how, after "Fifine at the
Fair," frightful symptoms set in, till in despair he took up "Red Cotton
Nightcap Country," and fell for hours into a dull comatose misery. "His
eyes were bloodshot, his hair was pushed in disorder about his head, his
cheeks were flushed, his hands were trembling, the nerves in his face
<a name="page111" id="page111">were</a> twitching. Then he arose, and
solemnly cursed Robert Browning. And then he took all his volumes, and,
disposing them carefully in the fireplace, set light to them. 'I wish,'
he said, 'that I could put the poet there too.'" One other anecdote of
the kind was often, with evident humorous appreciation, recounted by the
poet. On his introduction to the Chinese Ambassador, as a "brother-poet,"
he asked that dignitary what kind of poetic expression he particularly
affected. The great man deliberated, and then replied that his poetry
might be defined as "enigmatic." Browning at once admitted his fraternal
kinship.</p>

<p>That he was himself aware of the shortcomings of "Sordello" as a work of
art is not disputable. In 1863, Mrs. Orr says, he considered the
advisability of "rewriting it in a more transparent manner, but
concluded that the labour would be disproportionate to the result, and
contented himself with summarising the contents of each 'book' in a
continuous heading, which represents the main thread of the story."</p>

<p>The essential manliness of Browning is evident in the famous dedication
to the French critic Milsand, who was among his early admirers. "My own
faults of expression were many; but with care for a man or book such
would be surmounted, and without it what avails the faultlessness of
either? I blame nobody, least of all myself, who did my best then and
since."</p>

<p>Whatever be the fate of "Sordello," one thing pertinent to it shall
survive: the memorable sentence in the dedicatory preface--"My stress
lay on the <a name="page112" id="page112">incidents</a> in the development
of a soul: little else is worth study."</p>

<p>The poem has disastrous faults, but is a magnificent failure. "Vast as
night," to borrow a simile from Victor Hugo, but, like night,
innumerously starred.</p>

<h2><a name="page113" id="page113">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p>"Pippa Passes," "The Ring and the Book," "The Inn Album," these are
Browning's three great dramatic poems, as distinct from his poetic
plays. All are dramas in the exact sense, though the three I have named
are dramas for mental and not for positive presentation. Each reader
must embody for himself the images projected on his brain by the
electric quality of the poet's genius: within the ken of his imagination
he may perceive scenes not less moving, incidents not less thrilling,
complexities of motive and action not less intricately involved, than
upon the conventional stage.</p>

<p>The first is a drama of an idea, the second of the immediate and remote
consequences of a single act, the third of the tyranny of the passions.</p>

<p>I understand the general opinion among lovers and earnest students of
Browning's poetry to be that the highest peaks of his genius tower from
the vast tableland of "The Ring and the Book"; that thenceforth there
was declension. But Browning is not to be measured by common estimates.
It is easy to indicate, in the instances of many poets, just where the
music reaches its sweetest, its noblest, just where the extreme glow
wanes, just where the first shadows come leaping
<a name="page114" id="page114">like</a> greyhounds, or
steal almost imperceptibly from slow-closing horizons.</p>

<p>But with Browning, as with Shakspere, as with Victor Hugo, it is
difficult for our vision to penetrate the glow irradiating the supreme
heights of accomplishment. Like Balzac, like Shakspere again, he has
revealed to us a territory so vast, that while we bow down before the
sun westering athwart distant Andes, the gold of sunrise is already
flashing behind us, upon the shoulder of Atlas.</p>

<p>It is certain that "The Ring and the Book" is unique. Even Goethe's
masterpiece had its forerunners, as in Marlowe's "Faustus," and its
ambitious offspring, as in Bailey's "Festus." But is it a work of art?
Here is the only vital question which at present concerns us.</p>

<p>It is altogether useless to urge, as so many admirers of Browning do,
that "The Ring and the Book" is as full of beauties as the sea is of
waves. Undeniably it is, having been written in the poet's maturity.
But, to keep to the simile, has this epical poem the unity of ocean?
Does it consist of separate seas, or is it really one, as the wastes
which wash from Arctic to Antarctic, through zones temperate and
equatorial, are yet one and indivisible? If it have not this unity it is
still a stupendous accomplishment, but it is not a work of art. And
though art is but the handmaiden of genius, what student of Comparative
Literature will deny that nothing has survived the ruining breath of
Time--not any intellectual greatness nor any spiritual beauty, that is
not clad in perfection, be it absolute or relative--for relative
perfection there is, despite the apparent paradox.</p>

<p>The mere bulk of "The Ring and the Book" is, in
<a name="page115" id="page115">point</a> of art, nothing.
One day, after the publication of this poem, Carlyle hailed the author
with enthusiastic praise in which lurked damning irony: "What a
wonderful fellow you are, Browning: you have written a whole series of
'books' about what could be summed up in a newspaper paragraph!" Here,
Carlyle was at once right and wrong. The theme, looked at
dispassionately, is unworthy of the monument in which it is entombed for
eternity. But the poet looked upon the central incident as the inventive
mechanician regards the tiny pivot remote amid the intricate maze of his
machinery. Here, as elsewhere, Browning's real subject is too often
confounded with the accidents of the subject. His triumph is not that he
has created so huge a literary monument, but rather that,
notwithstanding its bulk, he has made it shapely and impressive. Stress
has frequently been laid on the greatness of the achievement in the
writing of twelve long poems in the exposition of one theme. Again, in
point of art, what significance has this? None. There is no reason why
it should not have been in nine or eleven parts; no reason why, having
been demonstrated in twelve, it should not have been expanded through
fifteen or twenty. Poetry ever looks askance at that gipsy-cousin of
hers, "Tour-de-force."</p>

<p>Of the twelve parts--occupying in all about twenty-one thousand
lines--the most notable as poetry are those which deal with the plea of
the implicated priest, Caponsacchi, with the meditation of the Pope, and
with the pathetic utterance of Pompilia. It is not a dramatic poem in
the sense that "Pippa Passes" is, for its ten Books (the first and
twelfth are respectively introductory and appendical) are monologues.
"The Ring and the <a name="page116" id="page116">Book</a>," in a word,
consists, besides the two extraneous parts, of ten monodramas, which
are as ten huge facets to a poetic Koh-i-Noor.</p>

<p>The square little Italian volume, in its yellow parchment and with its
heavy type, which has now found a haven in Oxford, was picked up by
Browning for a <i>lira</i> (about eightpence), on a second-hand bookstall
in the Piazza San Lorenzo at Florence, one June day, 1865. Therein is set
forth, in full detail, all the particulars of the murder of his wife
Pompilia, for her supposed adultery, by a certain Count Guido
Franceschini; and of that noble's trial, sentence, and doom. It is much
the same subject matter as underlies the dramas of Webster, Ford, and
other Elizabethan poets, but subtlety of insight rather than intensity
of emotion and situation distinguishes the Victorian dramatist from his
predecessors. The story fascinated Browning, who, having in this book
and elsewhere mastered all the details, conceived the idea of writing
the history of the crime in a series of monodramatic revelations on the
part of the individuals more or less directly concerned. The more he
considered the plan the more it shaped itself to a great accomplishment,
and early in 1866 he began the most ambitious work of his life.</p>

<p>An enthusiastic admirer has spoken of the poem as "one of the most
extraordinary feats of which we have any record in literature." But
poetry is not mental gymnastics. All this insistence upon "extraordinary
feats" is to be deprecated: it presents the poet as Hercules, not as
Apollo: in a word, it is not criticism. The story is one of vulgar fraud
and crime, romantic to us only because the incidents occurred in Italy,
in the <a name="page117" id="page117">picturesque</a> Rome and Arezzo of
two centuries ago. The old bourgeois couple, Pietro and Violante Comparini,
manage to wed their thirteen-year-old putative daughter to a middle-aged
noble of Arezzo. They expect the exquisite repute of an aristocratic
connection, and other tangible advantages. He, impoverished as he is,
looks for a splendid dowry. No one thinks of the child-wife, Pompilia.
She becomes the scapegoat, when the gross selfishness of the contracting
parties stands revealed. Count Guido has a genius for domestic tyranny.
Pompilia suffers. When she is about to become a mother she determines to
leave her husband, whom she now dreads as well as dislikes. Since the child
is to be the inheritor of her parents' wealth, she will not leave it to the
tender mercies of Count Guido. A young priest, a canon of Arezzo,
Giuseppe Caponsacchi, helps her to escape. In due course she gives birth
to a son. She has scarce time to learn the full sweetness of her
maternity ere she is done to death like a trampled flower. Guido, who
has held himself thrall to an imperative patience, till his hold upon
the child's dowry should be secure, hires four assassins, and in the
darkness of night betakes himself to Rome. He and his accomplices enter
the house of Pietro Comparini and his wife, and, not content with
slaying them, also murders Pompilia. But they are discovered, and Guido
is caught red-handed. Pompilia's evidence alone is damnatory, for she
was not slain outright, and lingers long enough to tell her story.
Franceschini is not foiled yet, however. His plea is that he simply
avenged the wrong done to him by his wife's adulterous connection with
the priest Caponsacchi. But even in the Rome of that evil day justice
was not extinct. <a name="page118" id="page118">Guido's</a> motive is
proved to be false; he himself is condemned to death. An appeal to the
Pope is futile. Finally, the wretched man pays the too merciful penalty
of his villainy.</p>

<p>There is nothing grand, nothing noble here: at most only a tragic pathos
in the fate of the innocent child-wife Pompilia. It is clear, therefore,
that the greatness of "The Ring and the Book" must depend even less upon
its subject, its motive, than upon its being "an extraordinary feat" in
the gymnastics of verse.</p>

<p>In a sense, Browning's longest work is akin to that of his wife. Both
"The Ring and the Book" and "Aurora Leigh" are metrical novels. The one
is discursive in episodes and spiritual experiences: the other in
intricacies of evidence. But there the parallel ends. If "The Ring and
the Book" were deflowered of its blooms of poetry and rendered into a
prose narrative, it might interest a barrister "getting up" a criminal
case, but it would be much inferior to, say, "The Moonstone"; its author
would be insignificant beside the ingenious M. Gaboriau. The
extraordinariness of the feat would then be but indifferently commented
upon.</p>

<p>As neither its subject, nor its extraordinariness as a feat, nor its
method, will withstand a searching examination, we must endeavour to
discern if transcendent poetic merit be discoverable in the treatment.
To arrive at a just estimate it is needful to free the mind not merely
from preconceptions, but from that niggardliness of insight which can
perceive only the minor flaws and shortcomings almost inevitable to any
vast literary achievement, and be blind to the superb merits. One must
prepare oneself to listen to a new musician, with
<a name="page119" id="page119">mind</a> and body alert
to the novel harmonies, and oblivious of what other musicians have done
or refrained from doing.</p>

<p>"The Ring and the Book," as I have said, was not begun in the year of
its imagining.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref15" id="fnref15" href="#fn15">[15]</a></span>
It is necessary to anticipate the biographical narrative, and state
that the finding of the parchment-booklet happened in the fourth year
of the poet's widowerhood, for his happy married period of less than
fifteen years came to a close in 1861.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn15" id="fn15" href="#fnref16">[15]</a></span>
The title is explained as follows:--"The story of the
Franceschini case, as Mr. Browning relates it, forms a circle of
evidence to its one central truth; and this circle was constructed in
the manner in which the worker in Etruscan gold prepares the ornamental
circlet which will be worn as a ring. The pure metal is too soft to bear
hammer or file; it must be mixed with alloy to gain the necessary power
of resistance. The ring once formed and embossed, the alloy is
disengaged, and a pure gold ornament remains. Mr. Browning's material
was also inadequate to his purpose, though from a different cause. It
was too <i>hard</i>. It was 'pure crude fact,' secreted from the fluid
being of the men and women whose experience it had formed. In its existing
state it would have broken up under the artistic attempt to weld and
round it. He supplied an alloy, the alloy of fancy, or--as he also calls
it--of one fact more: this fact being the echo of those past existences
awakened within his own. He breathed into the dead record the breath of
his own life; and when his ring of evidence had re-formed, first in
elastic then in solid strength, here delicately incised, there broadly
stamped with human thought and passion, he could cast fancy aside, and
bid his readers recognise in what he set before them unadulterated human
truth."--<i>Mrs. Orr</i>.
</div>

<p>On the afternoon of the day on which he made his purchase he read the
book from end to end. "A Spirit laughed and leapt through every limb."
The midsummer heats had caused thunder-clouds to
<a name="page120" id="page120">congregate</a> above
Vallombrosa and the whole valley of Arno: and the air in Florence was
painfully sultry. The poet stood by himself on his terrace at Casa
Guidi, and as he watched the fireflies wandering from the enclosed
gardens, and the sheet-lightnings quivering through the heated
atmosphere, his mind was busy in refashioning the old tale of loveless
marriage and crime.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in14">"Beneath</span><br />
      I' the street, quick shown by openings of the sky<br />
      When flame fell silently from cloud to cloud,<br />

      The townsmen walked by twos and threes, and talked,<br />
      Drinking the blackness in default of air--<br />
      A busy human sense beneath my feet:<br />

<p class="noindent">Scene by scene was re-enacted, though of course only
in certain essential details. The final food for the imagination was found
in a pamphlet of which he came into possession of in London, where several
important matters were given which had no place in the volume he had
picked up in Florence.</p>

<p>Much, far the greater part, of the first "book" is--interesting! It is
mere verse. As verse, even, it is often so involved, so musicless
occasionally, so banal now and again, so inartistic in colour as well as
in form, that one would, having apprehended its explanatory interest,
pass on without regret, were it not for the noble close--the passionate,
out-welling lines to "the truest poet I have ever known," the beautiful
soul who had given her all to him, whom, but four years before he
<a name="page121" id="page121">wrote</a> these words, he had laid to rest
among the cypresses and ilexes of the old Florentine garden of the dead.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"O lyric Love, half angel and half bird<br />
      And all a wonder and a wild desire,--<br />

</div>

<p>Thereafter, for close upon five thousand words, the poem descends again
to the level of a versified tale. It is saved from ruin by subtlety of
intellect, striking dramatic verisimilitude, an extraordinary vigour,
and occasional lines of real poetry. Retrospectively, apart from the
interest, often strained to the utmost, most readers,
<a name="page122" id="page122">I</a> fancy, will recall with
lingering pleasure only the opening of "The Other Half
Rome," the description of Pompilia, "with the patient brow and
lamentable smile," with flower-like body, in white hospital array--a
child with eyes of infinite pathos, "whether a flower or weed, ruined:
who did it shall account to Christ."</p>

<p>In these three introductory books we have the view of the matter taken
by those who side with Count Guido, of those who are all for Pompilia,
and of the "superior person," impartial because superciliously
indifferent, though sufficiently interested to "opine."</p>

<p>In the ensuing three books a much higher poetic level is reached. In the
first, Guido speaks; in the second, Caponsacchi; the third, that
lustrous opal set midway in the "Ring," is Pompilia's narrative. Here
the three protagonists live and move before our eyes. The sixth book may
be said to be the heart of the whole poem. The extreme intellectual
subtlety of Guido's plea stands quite unrivalled in poetic literature.
In comparing it, for its poetic beauty, with other sections, the reader
must bear in mind that in a poem of a dramatic nature the dramatic
proprieties must be dominant. It would be obviously inappropriate to
make Count Guido Franceschini speak with the dignity of the Pope, with
the exquisite pathos of Pompilia, with the ardour, like suppressed
molten lava, of Caponsacchi. The self-defence of the latter is a superb
piece of dramatic writing. Once or twice the flaming volcano of his
heart bursts upward uncontrollably, as when he cries--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"No, sirs, I cannot have the lady dead!<br />
      That erect form, flashing brow, fulgurant eye,<br />
     <a name="page123" id="page123">That</a> voice immortal (oh, that voice of hers!)--<br />
      That vision of the pale electric sword<br />

      I had saved her: do you dare say she spoke false?<br />
      Let me see for myself if it be so!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Than the poignant pathos and beauty of "Pompilia,"
there is nothing more exquisite in our literature. It stands alone.
Here at last we have the poet who is the Lancelot to Shakspere's Arthur.
It takes a supreme effort of genius to be as simple as a child. How
marvellously, after the almost sublime hypocrisy of the end of Guido's
defence, after the beautiful dignity of Caponsacchi's closing words,
culminating abruptly in the heart-wrung cry, "O great, just, good God!
miserable me!"--how marvellously comes upon the reader the delicate,
tearful tenderness of the innocent child-wife--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"I am just seventeen years and five months old,<br />
      And, if I lived one day more, three full weeks;<br />

      At length, so many names for one poor child,<br />
      --Francesca Camilla Vittoria Angela<br />
      Pompilia Comparini--laughable!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Only two writers of our age have depicted women with
that imaginative insight which is at once more comprehensive and more
illuminative than women's own invision of themselves--Robert Browning
and George Meredith, but not even the latter, most subtle and delicate
of all analysts of the tragi-comedy of human life, has surpassed "Pompilia."
The meeting and the swift <a name="page124" id="page124">uprising</a> of
love between Lucy and Richard, in "The Ordeal of Richard Feveral," is,
it is true, within the highest reach of prose romance: but between
even the loftiest height of prose romance and the altitudes of poetry,
there is an impassable gulf.</p>

<p>And as it is with simplicity so it is with tenderness. Only the sternly
strong can be supremely tender. And infinitely tender is the poetry of
"Pompilia"--</p>

<div class="poem">

exquisite na&iuml;vet&eacute;, where Pompilia relates why she called her

forget that plaintive voice, so poignantly sweet, that ineffable dying

<p>But the two succeeding "books" are more tiresome and more unnecessary
than the most inferior of the <a name="page126" id="page126">three</a>
opening sections--the first of the two, indeed, is intolerably wearisome,
a desolate boulder-strewn gorge after the sweet air and sunlit summits of
"Caponsacchi" and "Pompilia." In the next "book" Innocent XII. is revealed.
All this section has a lofty serenity, unsurpassed in its kind. It must be
read from first to last for its full effect, but I may excerpt one passage,
the high-water mark of modern blank-verse:--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"For the main criminal I have no hope<br />
      Except in such a suddenness of fate.<br />
      I stood at Naples once, a night so dark<br />
      I could have scarce conjectured there was earth<br />
      Anywhere, sky or sea or world at all:<br />
      But the night's black was burst through by a blaze--<br />
      Thunder struck blow on blow, earth groaned and bore,<br />
      Through her whole length of mountain visible:<br />
      There lay the city thick and plain with spires,<br />
      And, like a ghost disshrouded, white the sea.<br />
      So may the truth be flashed out by one blow,<br />
      And Guido see, one instant, and be saved."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Finally comes that throbbing, terrible last "book"
where the murderer finds himself brought to bay and knows that all is
lost. Who can forget its unparalleled close, when the wolf-like Guido
suddenly, in his supreme agony, transcends his lost manhood in one
despairing cry--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Abate,--Cardinal,--Christ,--Maria,--God, ...<br />
      Pompilia, will you let them murder me?"</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, the Epilogue rounds off the tale. But is this Epilogue
necessary? Surely the close should have come with the words just quoted?</p>

<p><a name="page127" id="page127">It</a> will not be after a first perusal
that the reader will be able to arrive at a definite conviction. No
individual or collective estimate of to-day can be accepted as final.
Those who come after us, perhaps not the next generation, nor the next
again, will see "The Ring and the Book" free of all the manifold and
complex considerations which confuse our judgment. Meanwhile, each can
only speak for himself. To me it seems that "The Ring and the Book" is,
regarded as an artistic whole, the most magnificent failure in our
literature. It enshrines poetry which no other than our greatest could
have written; it has depths to which many of far inferior power have not
descended. Surely the poem must be judged by the balance of its success
and failure? It is in no presumptuous spirit, but out of my profound
admiration of this long-loved and often-read, this superb poem, that I,
for one, wish it comprised but the Prologue, the Plea of Guido,
"Caponsacchi," "Pompilia," "The Pope," and Guido's last Defence.
I cannot help thinking that this is the form in which it will be read
in the years to come. Thus circumscribed, it seems to me to be rounded
and complete, a great work of art void of the dross, the mere
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> which the true artist discards. But as it is, in all
its lordly poetic strength and flagging impulse, is it not, after all,
the true climacteric of Browning's genius?</p>

<p>"The Inn Album," a dramatic poem of extraordinary power, has so much
more markedly the defects of his qualities that I take it to be, at the
utmost, the poise of the first gradual refluence. This analogy of the
tidal ebb and flow may be observed with singular aptness in Browning's
life-work--the tide that <a name="page128" id="page128">first</a> moved
shoreward in the loveliness of "Pauline," and, with "long withdrawing
roar," ebbed in slow, just perceptible lapse to the poet's penultimate
volume. As for "Asolando," I would rather regard it as the gathering of
a new wave--nay, again rather, as the deep sound of ocean which the
outward surge has reached.</p>

<p>But for myself I do not accept "The Inn Album" as the first hesitant
swing of the tide. I seem to hear the resilient undertone all through
the long slow poise of "The Ring and the Book." Where then is the full
splendour and rush of the tide, where its culminating reach and power?</p>

<p>I should say in "Men and Women"; and by "Men and Women" I mean not
merely the poems comprised in the collection so entitled, but all in the
"Dramatic Romances," "Lyrics," and the "Dramatis Person&aelig;," all the short
pieces of a certain intensity of note and quality of power, to be found
in the later volumes, from "Pacchiarotto" to "Asolando."</p>

<p>And this because, in the words of the poet himself when speaking of
Shelley, I prefer to look for the highest attainment, not simply the
high--and, seeing it, to hold by it. Yet I am not oblivious of the mass
of Browning's lofty achievement, "to be known enduringly among men,"--an
achievement, even on its secondary level, so high, that around its
imperfect proportions, "the most elaborated productions of ordinary art
must arrange themselves as inferior illustrations."</p>

<p>How am I to convey concisely that which it would take a volume to do
adequately--an idea of the richest efflorescence of Browning's genius in
these unfading blooms which we will agree to include in "Men and
<a name="page129" id="page129">Women</a>"? How better--certainly it
would be impossible to be more succinct--than by the enumeration of
the contents of an imagined volume, to be called, say
"Transcripts from Life"?</p>

<p>It would be to some extent, but not rigidly, arranged chronologically.
It would begin with that masterpiece of poetic concision, where a whole
tragedy is burned in upon the brain in fifty-six lines, "My Last
Duchess." Then would follow "In a Gondola," that haunting lyrical drama
<i>in petto</i>, where the lover is stabbed to death as his heart is
beating against that of his mistress; "Cristina," with its keen
introspection; those delightfully stirring pieces, the "Cavalier-Tunes,"
"Through the Metidja to Abd-el-Kadr," and "The Pied Piper of Hamelin";
"The Flower's Name"; "The Flight of the Duchess"; "The Tomb at St.
Praxed's," the poem which educed Ruskin's enthusiastic praise for its
marvellous apprehension of the spirit of the Middle Ages; "Pictor Ignotus,"
and "The Lost Leader." But as there is not space for individual detail, and
as many of the more important are spoken of elsewhere in this volume, I
must take the reader's acquaintance with the poems for granted. So,
following those first mentioned, there would come "Home Thoughts from
Abroad"; "Home Thoughts from the Sea"; "The Confessional"; "The
Heretic's Tragedy"; "Earth's Immortalities"; "Meeting at Night: Parting
at Morning"; "Saul"; "Karshish"; "A Death in the Desert"; "Rabbi Ben

<p>But having drawn up this imaginary anthology, possibly with faults of
commission and probably with worse errors of omission, I should like to
take the reader into my confidence concerning a certain volume,
originally compiled for my own pleasure, though not without thought of
one or two dear kinsmen of a scattered Brotherhood--a volume half the
size of the projected Transcripts, and rare as that star in the tip of
the moon's horn of which Coleridge speaks.</p>

<p><a name="page133" id="page133">It</a> is here--I will not say in
<i>Flower o' the Vine</i>, nor even venture to restrictively affirm
it of that larger and fuller compilation we have agreed, for the moment,
to call "Transcripts from Life"--it is here, in the worthiest poems of
Browning's most poetic period, that, it seems to me, his highest greatness
is to be sought. In these "Men and Women" he is, in modern times, an
unparalleled dramatic poet. The influence he exercises through these,
and the incalculably cumulative influence which will leaven many
generations to come, is not to be looked for in individuals only, but
in the whole thought of the age, which he has moulded to new form,
animated anew, and to which he has imparted a fresh stimulus. For this
a deep debt is due to Robert Browning. But over and above this shaping
force, this manipulative power upon character and thought, he has
enriched our language, our literature, with a new wealth of poetic
diction, has added to it new symbols, has enabled us to inhale a more
liberal if an unfamiliar air, has, above all, raised us to a fresh
standpoint, a standpoint involving our construction of a new definition.</p>

<p>Here, at least, we are on assured ground: here, at any rate, we realise
the scope and quality of his genius. But, let me hasten to add, he, at
his highest, not being of those who would make Imagination the handmaid
of the Understanding, has given us also a Dorado of pure poetry, of
priceless worth. Tried by the severest tests, not merely of substance,
but of form, not merely of the melody of high thinking, but of rare and
potent verbal music, the larger number of his "Men and Women" poems are
as treasurable acquisitions, in kind, to our literature, as the shorter
poems of Milton, of Shelley, <a name="page134" id="page134">of</a> Keats,
and of Tennyson. But once again, and finally, let me repeat that his
primary importance--not greatness, but importance--is in having forced
us to take up a novel standpoint, involving our construction of a new
definition.</p>

<hr class="long" />

<h2><a name="page135" id="page135">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p>There are, in literary history, few <i>sc&egrave;nes de la vie priv&eacute;e</i> more
affecting than that of the greatest of English poetesses, in the
maturity of her first poetic period, lying, like a fading flower, for
hours, for days continuously, in a darkened room in a London house. So
ill was Miss Elizabeth Barrett, early in the second half of the forties,
that few friends, herself even, could venture to hope for a single one
of those Springs which she previsioned so longingly. To us, looking back
at this period, in the light of what we know of a story of singular
beauty, there is an added pathos in the circumstance that, as the singer
of so many exquisite songs lay on her invalid's sofa, dreaming of things
which, as she thought, might never be, all that was loveliest in her
life was fast approaching--though, like all joy, not without an equally
unlooked-for sorrow. "I lived with visions for my company, instead of
men and women ... nor thought to know a sweeter music than they played
to me."</p>

<p>This is not the occasion, and if it were, there would still be
imperative need for extreme concision, whereon to dwell upon the early
life of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The particulars of it are familiar
to all who love English literature: for there is, in truth, not much to
tell--not <a name="page136" id="page136">much,</a> at least, that can well
be told. It must suffice, here, that Miss Barrett was born on the 4th of
March 1809, and so was the senior, by three years, of Robert Browning.</p>

<p>By 1820, in remote Herefordshire, the not yet eleven-year-old poetess
had already "cried aloud on obsolete Muses from childish lips" in
various "nascent odes, epics, and didactics." At this time, she tells
us, the Greeks were her demi-gods, and she dreamt much of Agamemnon. In
the same year, in suburban Camberwell, a little boy was often wont to
listen eagerly to his father's narrative of the same hero, and to all
the moving tale of Troy. It is significant that these two children, so
far apart, both with the light of the future upon their brows, grew up
in familiarity with something of the antique beauty. It was a lifelong
joy to both, that "serene air of Greece." Many an hour of gloom was
charmed away by it for the poetess who translated the "Prometheus Bound"
of &AElig;schylus, and wrote "The Dead Pan": many a happy day and memorable
night were spent in that "beloved environment" by the poet who wrote
"Balaustion's Adventure" and translated the "Agamemnon."</p>

<p>The chief sorrow of her life, however, occurred in her thirty-first
year. She never quite recovered from the shock of her well-loved brother
Edward's tragic death, a mysterious disaster, for the foundering of the
little yacht <i>La Belle Sauvage</i> is almost as inexplicable as that of
the <i>Ariel</i> in the Spezzian waters beyond Lerici. Not only through the
ensuing winter, but often in the dreams of after years, "the sound of
the waves rang in my ears like the moans of one dying."</p>

<p><a name="page137" id="page137">The</a> removal of the Barrett household
to Gloucester Place, in Western London, was a great event. Here, invalid
though she was, she could see friends occasionally and get new books
constantly. Her name was well known and became widely familiar when her
"Cry of the Children" rang like a clarion throughout the country. The poem
was founded upon an official report by Richard Hengist Horne, the friend
whom some years previously she had won in correspondence, and with whom
she had become so intimate, though without personal acquaintance, that
she had agreed to write a drama in collaboration with him, to be called
"Psyche Apocalypt&eacute;," and to be modelled on "Greek instead of modern tragedy."</p>

<p>Horne--a poet of genius, and a dramatist of remarkable power--was one of
the truest friends she ever had, and, so far as her literary life is
concerned, came next in influence only to her poet-husband. Among the
friends she saw much of in the early forties was a distant "cousin,"
John Kenyon--a jovial, genial, gracious, and altogether delightful man,
who acted the part of Providence to many troubled souls, and, in
particular, was "a fairy godfather" to Elizabeth Barrett and to "the
other poet," as he used to call Browning. It was to Mr. Kenyon--"Kenyon,
with the face of a Bendectine monk, but the most jovial of good
fellows," as a friend has recorded of him; "Kenyon the Magnificent," as
he was called by Browning--that Miss Barrett owed her first introduction
to the poetry of her future husband.</p>

<p>Browning's poetry had for her an immediate appeal. With sure insight she
discerned the special quality of the <a name="page138" id="page138">poetic</a>
wealth of the "Bells and Pomegranates," among which she then and always
cared most for the penultimate volume, the "Dramatic Romances and Lyrics."
Two years before she met the author she had written, in "Lady Geraldine's
Courtship"--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Or from Browning some 'Pomegranate' which, if cut deep down<br />
     <span class="in2">the middle,</span><br />
      Shows a heart within blood-tinctured, of a veined humanity."</p>
</div>

<p>A little earlier she had even, unwittingly on either side, been a
collaborateur with "the author of 'Paracelsus.'" She gave Horne much aid
in the preparation of his "New Spirit of the Age," and he has himself
told us "that the mottoes, which are singularly happy and appropriate,
were for the most part supplied by Miss Barrett and Robert Browning,
then unknown to each other." One thing and another drew them nearer and
nearer. Now it was a poem, now a novel expression, now a rare sympathy.</p>

<p>An intermittent correspondence ensued, and both poets became anxious to
know each other. "We artists--how well praise agrees with us," as Balzac
says.</p>

<p>A few months later, in 1846, they came to know one another personally.
The story of their first meeting, which has received a wide acceptance,
is apocryphal. The meeting was brought about by Kenyon. This common
friend had been a schoolfellow of Browning's father, and so it was
natural that he took a more than ordinary interest in the brilliant
young poet, perhaps all the more so that the reluctant tide of
popularity which had promised to set in with such unparalleled sweep and
weight had since experienced a steady ebb.</p>

<p><a name="page139" id="page139">And</a> so the fates brought these two
together. The younger was already far the stronger, but he had an unbounded
admiration for Miss Barrett. To her, he was even then the chief living poet.
She perceived his ultimate greatness; as early as 1845 had "a full faith in
him as poet and prophet."</p>

<p>As Browning admitted to a friend, the love between them was almost
instantaneous, a thing of the eyes, mind, and heart--each striving for
supremacy, till all were gratified equally in a common joy. They had one
bond of sterling union: passion for the art to which both had devoted
their lives.</p>

<p>To those who love love for love's sake, who <i>se passionnent pour la
passion</i>, as Prosper Merim&eacute;e says, there could scarce be a more sacred
spot in London than that fiftieth house in unattractive Wimpole Street,
where these two poets first met each other; and where, in the darkened
room, "Love quivered, an invisible flame." Elizabeth Barrett was indeed,
in her own words, "as sweet as Spring, as Ocean deep." She, too, was
always, as she wrote of Harriet Martineau, in a hopeless anguish of body
and serene triumph of spirit. As George Sand says, of one of her
fictitious personages, she was an "artist to the backbone; that is, one
who feels life with frightful intensity." To this too keen intensity of
feeling must be attributed something of that longing for repose, that
deep craving for rest from what is too exciting from within, which made
her affirm the exquisite appeal to her of such Biblical passages as "The
Lord of peace Himself give you peace," and "He giveth His Beloved
Sleep," which, as she says in one of her numerous letters to Miss
Mitford, "strike upon the <a name="page140" id="page140">disquieted</a>
earth with such a <i>foreignness</i> of heavenly music."</p>

<p>Nor was he whom she loved as a man, as well as revered as a poet,
unworthy of her. His was the robustest poetic intellect of the century;
his the serenest outlook; his, almost the sole unfaltering footsteps
along the perilous ways of speculative thought. A fair life, irradiate
with fairer ideals, conserved his native integrity from that incongruity
between practice and precept so commonly exemplified. Comely in all
respects, with his black-brown wavy hair, finely-cut features, ready and
winsome smile, alert luminous eyes, quick, spontaneous, expressive
gestures--an inclination of the head, a lift of the eyebrows, a
modulation of the lips, an assertive or deprecatory wave of the hand,
conveying so much--and a voice at that time of a singular penetrating
sweetness, he was, even without that light of the future upon his
forehead which she was so swift to discern, a man to captivate any woman
of kindred nature and sympathies. Over and above these advantages, he
possessed a rare quality of physical magnetism. By virtue of this he
could either attract irresistibly or strongly repel.</p>

<p>I have several times heard people state that a hand-shake from Browning
was like an electric shock. Truly enough, it did seem as though his
sterling nature rang in his genially dominant voice, and, again, as
though his voice transmitted instantaneous waves of an electric current
through every nerve of what, for want of a better phrase, I must
perforce call his intensely alive hand. I remember once how a lady,
afflicted with nerves, in the dubious enjoyment of her first experience
of a "literary afternoon," rose hurriedly and, in reply to her hostess'
<a name="page141" id="page141">inquiry</a> as to her motive, explained
that she could not sit any longer beside the elderly gentleman who was
talking to Mrs. So-and-so, as his near presence made her quiver all over,
"like a mild attack of pins-and-needles," as she phrased it. She was
chagrined to learn that she had been discomposed not by 'a too exuberant
financier,' as she had surmised, but by, as "Waring" called Browning, the
"subtlest assertor of the Soul in song."</p>

<p>With the same quick insight as she had perceived Robert Browning's
poetic greatness, Elizabeth Barrett discerned his personal worth. He was
essentially manly in all respects: so manly, that many frail souls of
either sex philandered about his over-robustness. From the twilight
gloom of an &aelig;esthetic clique came a small voice belittling the great man
as "quite too 'loud,' painfully excessive." Browning was manly enough to
laugh at all ghoulish cries of any kind whatsoever. Once in a way the
lion would look round and by a raised breath make the jackals wriggle;
as when the poet wrote to a correspondent, who had drawn his attention
to certain abusive personalities in some review or newspaper: "Dear
Sir--I am sure you mean very kindly, but I have had too long an
experience of the inability of the human goose to do other than cackle
when benevolent and hiss when malicious, and no amount of goose
criticism shall make me lift a heel against what waddles behind it."</p>

<p>Herself one whose happiest experiences were in dreamland, Miss Barrett
was keenly susceptible to the strong humanity of Browning's song, nor
less keenly attracted by his strenuous and fearless outlook, his poetic
practicality, and even by his bluntness of insight in certain
<a name="page142" id="page142">matters.</a> It was no slight thing to her
that she could, in Mr. Lowell's words, say of herself and of him--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"We, who believe life's bases rest<br />
      Beyond the probe of chemic test."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">She rejoiced, despite her own love for remote imaginings, to know that
he was of those who (to quote again from the same fine poet)</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">". . . wasted not their breath in schemes<br />
      Of what man might be in some bubble-sphere,<br />
      As if he must be other than he seems<br />
      Because he was not what he should be here,<br />
      Postponing Time's slow proof to petulant dreams;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">that, in a word, while 'he could believe the promise of
to-morrow,' he was at the same time supremely conscious of 'the wondrous
meaning of to-day.'</p>

<p>Both, from their youth onward, had travelled 'on trails divine of
unimagined laws.' It was sufficient for her that he kept his eyes fixed
on the goal beyond the way he followed: it did not matter that he was
blind to the dim adumbrations of novel byways, of strange Calvarys by
the wayside, so often visible to her.</p>

<p>Their first meeting was speedily followed by a second--by a third--and
then? When we know not, but ere long, each found that happiness was in
the bestowal of the other.</p>

<p>The secret was for some time kept absolutely private. From the first Mr.
Barrett had been jealous of his beloved daughter's new friend. He did
not care much for the man, he with all the prejudices and baneful
conservatism of the slave-owning planter, the other
<a name="page143" id="page143">with</a> ardent democratic sentiments
and a detestation of all forms of iniquity. Nor did he understand
the poet. He could read his daughter's flowing verse with pleasure,
but there was to his ear a mere jumble of sound and sense in much of
the work of the author of "The Tomb at St. Praxed's" and
"Sibrandus Schafnaburgensis." Of a selfishly genial but also of a
violent and often sullen nature, he resented more and more any
friendship which threatened to loosen the chain of affection and
association binding his daughter to himself.</p>

<p>Both the lovers believed that an immediate marriage would, from every
point of view, be best. It was not advisable that it should be long
delayed, if to happen at all, for the health of Miss Barrett was so poor
that another winter in London might, probably would, mean irretrievable
harm.</p>

<p>Some time before this she had become acquainted with Mrs. Jameson, the
eminent art-writer. The regard, which quickly developed to an
affectionate esteem, was mutual. One September morning Mrs. Jameson
called, and after having dwelt on the gloom and peril of another winter
in London, dwelt on the magic of Italy, and concluded by inviting Miss
Barrett to accompany her in her own imminent departure for abroad. The
poet was touched and grateful, but, pointing to her invalid sofa, and
gently emphasising her enfeebled health and other difficult
circumstances, excused herself from acceptance of Mrs. Jameson's
generous offer.</p>

<p>In the "Memoirs of Mrs. Jameson" that lady's niece, Mrs. Macpherson,
relates how on the eve of her and her aunt's departure, a little note of
farewell arrived from <a name="page144" id="page144">Miss</a> Barrett,
"deploring the writer's inability to come in person and bid her friend
good-bye, as she was 'forced to be satisfied with the sofa and silence.'"</p>

<p>It is easy to understand, therefore, with what amazement Mrs. Jameson,
shortly after her arrival in Paris, received a letter from Robert
Browning to the effect that he <i>and his wife</i> had just come from
London, on their way to Italy. "My aunt's surprise was something almost
comical," writes Mrs. Macpherson, "so startling and entirely unexpected
was the news." And duly married indeed the two poets had been!</p>

<p>From the moment the matter was mooted to Mr. Barrett, he evinced his
repugnance to the idea. To him even the most foolish assertion of his
own was a sacred pledge. He called it "pride in his word": others
recognised it as the very arrogance of obstinacy. He refused to
countenance the marriage in any way, refused to have Browning's name
mentioned in his presence, and even when his daughter told him that she
had definitely made up her mind, he flatly declined to acknowledge as
even possible what was indeed very imminent.</p>

<p>Nor did he ever step down from his ridiculous pinnacle of wounded
self-love. Favourite daughter though she had been, Mr. Barrett never
forgave her, held no communication with her even when she became a
mother, and did not mention her in his will. It is needless to say
anything more upon this subject. What Mr. and Mrs. Browning were
invariably reticent upon can well be passed over with mere mention of
the facts.</p>

<p>At the last moment there had been great hurry and confusion. But
nevertheless, on the forenoon of the <a name="page145" id="page145">12th</a>
of September 1846, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett had unceremoniously
stepped into St. Maryle-bone Church and there been married. So secret had
the matter been kept that even such old friends as Richard Hengist Horne
and Mr. Kenyon were in ignorance of the event for some time after it had
actually occurred.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jameson made all haste to the hotel where the Brownings were, and
ultimately persuaded them to leave the hotel for the quieter <i>pension</i>
in the Rue Ville d'Evêque, where she and Mrs. Macpherson were staying.
Thereafter it was agreed that, as soon as a fortnight had gone by, they
should journey to Italy together.</p>

<p>Truly enough, as Mrs. Macpherson says, the journey must have been
"enchanting, made in such companionship." Before departing from Paris,
Mrs. Jameson, in writing to a friend, alluded to her unexpected
companions, and added, "Both excellent: but God help them! for I know
not how the two poet heads and poet hearts will get on through this
prosaic world." This kindly friend was not the only person who
experienced similar doubts. One acquaintance, no other than the
Poet-Laureate, Wordsworth, added: "So, Robert Browning and Elizabeth
Barrett have gone off together! Well, I hope they may understand each
other--nobody else could!"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact they did, and to such good intent that they seem
never to have had one hour of dissatisfaction, never one jar in the
music of their lives.</p>

<p>What a happy wayfaring through France that must have been! The
travelling had to be slow, and with frequent interruptions, on account
of Mrs. Browning's <a name="page146" id="page146">health</a>: yet she
steadily improved, and was almost from the start able to take more
exercise, and to be longer in the open air than had for long been her wont.
They passed southward, and after some novel experiences in <i>diligences</i>,
reached Avignon, where they rested for a couple of days. Thence a little
expedition, a poetical pilgrimage, was made to Vaucluse, sacred to the
memory of Petrarch and Laura. There, as Mrs. Macpherson has told us, at
the very source of the "chiare, fresche e dolce acque," Browning took
his wife up in his arms, and, carrying her across through the shallow
curling waters, seated her on a rock that rose throne-like in the middle
of the stream. Thus, indeed, did love and poetry take a new possession
of the spot immortalised by Petrarch's loving fancy.</p>

<p>Three weeks passed happily before Pisa, the Brownings' destination, was
reached. But even then the friends were unwilling to part, and Mrs.
Jameson and her niece remained in the deserted old city for a score of
days longer. So wonderful was the change wrought in Mrs. Browning by
happiness, and by all the enfranchisement her marriage meant for her,
that, as her friend wrote to Miss Mitford, "she is not merely improved
but transformed." In the new sunshine which had come into her life, she
blossomed like a flower-bud long delayed by gloom and chill. Her heart,
in truth, was like a lark when wafted skyward by the first spring-wind.</p>

<p>At last to her there had come something of that peace she had longed
for, and though, in the joy of her new life, her genius "like an Arab
bird slept floating in the wind," it was with that restful hush which
precedes the <a name="page147" id="page147">creative</a> storm. There is
something deeply pathetic in her conscious joy. So little actual experience
of life had been hers that in many respects she was as a child: and she
had all the child's yearning for those unsullied hours that never come
when once they are missed. But it was not till love unfastened the inner
chambers of her heart and brain that she realised to the full, what she
had often doubted, how supreme a thing mere life is. It was in some such
mood that she wrote the lovely forty-second of the "Sonnets from the
Portuguese," closing thus--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in8">"Let us stay</span><br />
      Rather on earth, Belov&egrave;d,--where the unfit<br />
      Contrarious moods of men recoil away<br />
      And isolate pure spirits, and permit<br />
      A place to stand and love in for a day,<br />
      With darkness and the death-hour rounding it."</p>
</div>

<p>As for Browning's love towards his wife, nothing more tender and
chivalrous has ever been told of ideal lovers in an ideal romance. It is
so beautiful a story that one often prefers it to the sweetest or
loftiest poem that came from the lips of either. That love knew no
soilure in the passage of the years. Like the flame of oriental legend,
it was perennially incandescent though fed not otherwise than by
sunlight and moonshine. If it alone survive, it may resolve the poetic
fame of either into one imperishable, luminous ray of white light: as
the uttered song fused in the deathless passion of Sappho gleams
star-like down the centuries from the high steep of Leucadoe.</p>

<p>It was here, in Pisa, I have been told on indubitable authority, that
Browning first saw in manuscript those "<a name="page148" id="page148">Sonnets</a>
from the Portuguese" which no poet of Portugal had ever written, which
no man could have written, which no other woman than his wife could have
composed. From the time when it had first dawned upon her that love was
to be hers, and that the laurel of poetry was not to be her sole coronal,
she had found expression for her exquisite trouble in these short poems,
which she thinly disguised from 'inner publicity' when she issued them as
"from the Portuguese."</p>

<p>It is pleasant to think of the shy delight with which the delicate,
flower-like, almost ethereal poet-wife, in those memorable Pisan
evenings--with the wind blowing soundingly from the hills of Carrara, or
quiescent in a deep autumnal calm broken only by the slow wash of Arno
along the sea-mossed long-deserted quays--showed her love-poems to her
husband. With what love and pride he must have read those outpourings of
the most sensitive and beautiful nature he had ever met, vials of lovely
thought and lovelier emotion, all stored against the coming of a golden
day.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.<br />

      I love thee to the level of every day's<br />

<p>Their Pisan home was amid sacred associations. It was situate in an old
palazzo built by Vasari, within sight of the Leaning Tower and the
Duomo. There, in absolute seclusion, they wrote and planned. Once and
again they made a pilgrimage to the Lanfranchi Palace "to walk in the
footsteps of Byron and Shelley": occasionally they went to Vespers in
the Duomo, and listened, rapt, to the music wandering spirally through
the vast solitary building: once they were fortunate in hearing the
impressive musical mass for the dead, in the Campo Santo. They were even
reminded often of their distant friend Horne, for every time they
crossed one of the chief piazzas they saw the statue of Cosimo de Medici
looking down upon them.</p>

<p>In this beautiful old city, so full of repose as it lies "asleep in the
sun," Mrs. Browning's health almost leapt, so swift was her advance
towards vigour. "She is getting better every day," wrote her husband,
"stronger, better wonderfully, and beyond all our hopes."</p>

<p>That happy first winter they passed "in the most secluded manner,
reading Vasari, and dreaming dreams of seeing Venice in the summer." But
early in April, when the swallows had flown inland above the pines of
Viareggio, and Shelley's favourite little Aziola was hooting silverly
among the hollow vales of Carrara, the <a name="page150" id="page150">two</a>
poets prepared to leave what the frailer of them called "this perch of Pisa."</p>

<p>But with all its charm and happy associations, the little city was dull.
"Even human faces divine are quite <i>rococo</i> with me," Mrs. Browning
wrote to a friend. The change to Florence was a welcome one to both.
Browning had already been there, but to his wife it was as the
fulfilment of a dream. They did not at first go to that romantic old
palace which will be for ever sociate with the author of "Casa Guidi
Windows," but found accommodation in a more central locality.</p>

<p>When the June heats came, husband and wife both declared for Ancona, the
picturesque little town which dreams out upon the Adriatic. But though
so close to the sea, Ancona is in summer time almost insufferably hot.
Instead of finding it cooler than Florence, it was as though they had
leapt right into a cauldron. Alluding to it months later, Mrs. Browning
wrote to Horne, "The heat was just the fiercest fire of your
imagination, and I <i>seethe</i> to think of it at this distance."</p>

<p>It was a memorable journey all the same. They went to Ravenna, and at
four o'clock one morning stood by Dante's tomb, moved deeply by the
pathetic inscription and by all the associations it evoked. All along
the coast from Ravenna to Loretto was new ground to both, and endlessly
fascinating; in the passing and repassing of the Apennines they had
'wonderful visions of beauty and glory.' At Ancona itself,
notwithstanding the heat, they spent a happy season. Here Browning wrote
one of the loveliest of his short poems, "The Guardian Angel," which had
its origin in Guercino's picture in the chapel at Fano. By the allusions
in the sixth and <a name="page151" id="page151">eighth</a> stanzas it is
clear that the poem was inscribed to Alfred Domett, the poet's well-loved
friend immortalised as "Waring." Doubtless it was written for no other
reason than the urgency of song, for in it are the loving allusions to
his wife, "<i>my</i> angel with me too," and "my love is here." Three
times they went to the chapel, he tells us in the seventh stanza, to drink
in to their souls' content the beauty of "dear Guercino's" picture.
Browning has rarely uttered the purely personal note of his inner life.
It is this that affords a peculiar value to "The Guardian Angel," over
and above its technical beauty. In the concluding lines of the stanzas
I am about to quote he gives the supreme expression to what was his
deepest faith, his profoundest song-motive.</p>

<p>After the Adriatic coast was left, they hesitated as to returning to
Florence, the doctors having laid such stress on the climatic
suitability of Pisa for Mrs. <a name="page152" id="page152">Browning</a>.
But she felt so sure of herself in her new strength that it was decided
to adventure upon at least one winter in the queen-city. They were
fortunate in obtaining a residence in the old palace called Casa Guidi,
in the Via Maggiore, over against the church of San Felice, and here,
with a few brief intervals, they lived till death separated them.</p>

<p>On the little terrace outside there was more noble verse fashioned in
the artist's creative silence than we can ever be aware of: but what a
sacred place it must ever be for the lover of poetry! There, one ominous
sultry eve, Browning, brooding over the story of a bygone Roman crime,
foreshadowed "The Ring and the Book," and there, in the many years he
dwelt in Casa Guidi, he wrote some of his finer shorter poems. There,
also, "Aurora Leigh" was born, and many a lyric fresh with the dew of
genius. Who has not looked at the old sunworn house and failed to think
of that night when each square window of San Felice was aglow with
festival lights, and when the summer lightnings fell silently in broad
flame from cloud to cloud: or has failed to hear, down the narrow
street, a little child go singing, 'neath Casa Guidi windows by the
church, <i>O bella libert&agrave;, O bella!</i></p>

<p>Better even than these, for happy dwelling upon, is the poem the two
poets lived. Morning and day were full of work, study, or that
pleasurable idleness which for the artist is so often his best
inspiration. Here, on the little terrace, they used to sit together, or
walk slowly to and fro, in conversation that was only less eloquent than
silence. Here one day they received a letter from Horne. There is
nothing of particular note in Mrs. Browning's
<a name="page153" id="page153">reply</a>, and yet there are
not a few of her poems we would miss rather than these chance
words--delicate outlines left for the reader to fill in: "We were
reading your letter, together, on our little terrace--walking up and
down reading it--I mean the letter to Robert--and then, at the end,
suddenly turning, lo, just at the edge of the stones, just between the
balustrades, and already fluttering in a breath of wind and about to fly
away over San Felice's church, we caught a glimpse of the feather of a
note to E.B.B. How near we were to the loss of it, to be sure!"</p>

<p>Happier still must have been the quiet evenings in late spring and
summer, when, the one shrouded against possible chills, the other
bare-headed and with loosened coat, walked slowly to and fro in the
dark, conscious of "a busy human sense" below, but solitary on their
balcony beyond the lamplit room.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"While in and out the terrace-plants, and round<br />
      One branch of tall datura, waxed and waned<br />
      The lamp-fly lured there, wanting the white flower."</p>
</div>

<p>An American friend has put on record his impressions of the two poets,
and their home at this time. He had been called upon by Browning, and by
him invited to take tea at Casa Guidi the same evening. There the
visitor saw, "seated at the tea-table of the great room of the palace in
which they were living, a very small, very slight woman, with very long
curls drooping forward, almost across the eyes, hanging to the bosom,
and quite concealing the pale, small face, from which the piercing
inquiring eyes looked out sensitively at the stranger. Rising from her
chair, she put out cordially the thin <a name="page154" id="page154">white</a>
hand of an invalid, and in a few moments they were pleasantly chatting,
while the husband strode up and down the room, joining in the conversation
with a vigour, humour, eagerness, and affluence of curious lore which,
with his trenchant thought and subtle sympathy, make him one of the most
charming and inspiring of companions."</p>

<p>In the autumn the same friend, joined by one or two other acquaintances,
went with the Brownings to Vallombrosa for a couple of days, greatly to
Mrs. Browning's delight, for whom the name had had a peculiar
fascination ever since she had first encountered it in Milton.</p>

<p>She was conveyed up the steep way towards the monastery in a great
basket, without wheels, drawn by two oxen: though, as she tells Miss
Mitford, she did not get into the monastery after all, she and her maid
being turned away by the monks "for the sin of womanhood." She was too
much of an invalid to climb the steeper heights, but loved to lie under
the great chestnuts upon the hill-slopes near the convent. At twilight
they went to the little convent-chapel, and there Browning sat down at
the organ and played some of those older melodies he loved so well.</p>

<p>It is, strangely enough, from Americans that we have the best account of
the Brownings in their life at Casa Guidi: from R.H. Stoddart, Bayard
Taylor, Nathaniel Hawthorne, George Stillman Hillard, and W.W. Story. I
can find room, however, for but one excerpt:--</p>

<blockquote>
     <p>"Those who have known Casa Guidi as it was, could hardly enter the
      loved rooms now, and speak above a whisper. They who have been so
      favoured, can never forget the square anteroom, with
      <a name="page155" id="page155">its</a> great
      picture and pianoforte, at which the boy Browning passed many an
      hour--the little dining-room covered with tapestry, and where hung
      medallions of Tennyson, Carlyle, and Robert Browning--the long
      room filled with plaster-casts and studies, which was Mrs.
      Browning's retreat--and, dearest of all, the large drawing-room
      where <i>she</i> always sat. It opens upon a balcony filled with
      plants, and looks out upon the iron-grey church of Santa Felice.
      There was something about this room that seemed to make it a
      proper and especial haunt for poets. The dark shadows and subdued
      light gave it a dreary look, which was enhanced by the
      tapestry-covered walls, and the old pictures of saints that looked
      out sadly from their carved frames of black wood. Large bookcases
      constructed of specimens of Florentine carving selected by Mr.
      Browning were brimming over with wise-looking books. Tables were
      covered with more gaily-bound volumes, the gifts of brother
      authors. Dante's grave profile, a cast of Keats's face and brow
      taken after death, a pen-and-ink sketch of Tennyson, the genial
      face of John Kenyon, Mrs. Browning's good friend and relative,
      little paintings of the boy Browning, all attracted the eye in
      turn, and gave rise to a thousand musings. A quaint mirror,
      easy-chairs and sofas, and a hundred nothings that always add an
      indescribable charm, were all massed in this room. But the glory
      of all, and that which sanctified all, was seated in a low
      arm-chair near the door. A small table, strewn with
      writing-materials, books, and newspapers, was always by her
      side.... After her death, her husband had a careful water-colour
      drawing made of this room, which has been engraved more than once.
      It still hangs in his drawing-room, where the mirror and one of
      the quaint chairs above named still are. The low arm-chair and
      small table are in Browning's study--with his father's desk, on
      which he has written all his poems."--(<i>W.W. Story</i>.)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne, Mr. Hillard, and Mr. Story, in particular, we
are indebted for several delightful glimpses into the home-life of the
two poets. We can see Mrs. Browning in her "ideal chamber," neither a
library nor a sitting-room, but a happy blending of
<a name="page156" id="page156">both</a>, with the
numerous old paintings in antique Florentine frames, easy-chairs and
lounges, carved bookcases crammed with books in many languages,
bric-a-brac in any quantity, but always artistic, flowers everywhere,
and herself the frailest flower of all.</p>

<p>Mr. Hillard speaks of the happiness of the Brownings' home and their
union as perfect: he, full of manly power, she, the type of the most
sensitive and delicate womanhood. This much-esteemed friend was
fascinated by Mrs. Browning. Again and again he alludes to her exceeding
spirituality: "She is a soul of fire enclosed in a shell of pearl:" her
frame "the transparent veil for a celestial and mortal spirit:" and
those fine words which prove that he too was of the brotherhood of the
poets, "Her tremulous voice often flutters over her words like the flame
of a dying candle over the wick."</p>

<h2><a name="page157" id="page157">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>With the flower-tide of spring in 1849 came a new happiness to the two
poets: the son who was born on the 9th of March. The boy was called
Robert Wiedemann Barrett, the second name, in remembrance of Browning's
much-loved mother, having been substituted for the "Sarianna" wherewith
the child, if a girl, was to have been christened. Thereafter their "own
young Florentine" was an endless joy and pride to both: and he was
doubly loved by his father for his having brought a renewal of life to
her who bore him.</p>

<p>That autumn they went to the country, to the neighbourhood of
Vallombrosa, and then to the Bagni di Lucca. There they wandered content
in chestnut-forests, and gathered grapes at the vintage.</p>

<p>Early in the year Browning's "Poetical Works" were published in two
volumes. Some of the most beautiful of his shorter poems are to be found
therein. What a new note is struck throughout, what range of subject
there is! Among them all, are there any more treasurable than two of the
simplest, "Home Thoughts from Abroad" and "Night and Morning"?</p>

<p><a name="page159" id="page159">The</a> following winter, when they were
again at their Florentine home, Browning wrote his "Christmas Eve and
Easter Day," that remarkable <i>apologia</i> for Christianity, and
close-reasoned presentation of the religious thought of the time. It is,
however, for this reason that it is so widely known and admired: for it
is ever easier to attract readers by dogma than by beauty, by
intellectual argument than by the seduction of art. Coincidently,
Mrs. Browning wrote the first portion of "Casa Guidi Windows."</p>

<p>In the spring of 1850 husband and wife spent a short stay in Rome. I
have been told that the poem entitled 'Two in the Campagna' was as
actually personal as the already quoted "Guardian Angel." But I do not
think stress should be laid on this and kindred localisations. Exact or
not, they have no literary value. To the poet, the dramatic poet above
all, locality and actuality of experience are, so to say, merely
fortunate coigns of outlook, for the winged genius to temporally
inhabit. To the imaginative mind, truth is not simply actuality. As for
'Two in the Campagna': it is too universally true to be merely personal.
There is a gulf which not the profoundest search can fathom, which not
the strongest-winged love can overreach: the gulf of individuality. It
is those who have loved most deeply who recognise most acutely this
always pathetic and often terrifying isolation of the soul. None save
the weak can believe in the absolute union of two spirits. If this were
demonstratable, immortality would be a palpable fiction. The moment
individuality can lapse to fusion, that moment the tide has ebbed, the
wind has fallen, the dream has been dreamed. So
<a name="page160" id="page160">long</a> as the soul
remains inviolate amid all shock of time and change, so long is it
immortal. No man, no poet assuredly, could love as Browning loved, and
fail to be aware, often with vague anger and bitterness, no doubt, of
this insuperable isolation even when spirit seemed to leap to spirit, in
the touch of a kiss, in the evanishing sigh of some one or other
exquisite moment. The poem tells us how the lovers, straying hand in
hand one May day across the Campagna, sat down among the seeding
grasses, content at first in the idle watching of a spider spinning her
gossamer threads from yellowing fennel to other vagrant weeds. All
around them</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"The champaign with its endless fleece<br />

</div>

<p>Let us too be unashamed of soul, the poet-lover says, even as earth lies
bare to heaven. Nothing is to be overlooked. But all in vain: in vain "I

<p>It was during this visit to Rome that both were
<a name="page161" id="page161">gratified</a> by the
proposal in the leading English literary weekly, that the
Poet-Laureateship, vacant by the death of Wordsworth, should be
conferred upon Mrs. Browning: though both rejoiced when they learned
that the honour had devolved upon one whom each so ardently admired as
Alfred Tennyson. In 1851 a visit was paid to England, not one very much
looked forward to by Mrs. Browning, who had never had cause to yearn for
her old home in Wimpole Street, and who could anticipate no
reconciliation with her father, who had persistently refused even to
open her letters to him, and had forbidden the mention of her name in
his home circle.</p>

<p>Bayard Taylor, in his travel-sketches published under the title "At Home
and Abroad," has put on record how he called upon the Brownings one
afternoon in September, at their rooms in Devonshire Street, and found
them on the eve of their return to Italy.</p>

<p>In his cheerful alertness, self-possession, and genial suavity Browning
impressed him as an American rather than as an Englishman, though there
can be no question but that no more thorough Englishman than the poet
ever lived. It is a mistake, of course, to speak of him as a typical
Englishman: for typical he was not, except in a very exclusive sense.
Bayard Taylor describes him in reportorial fashion as being apparently
about seven-and-thirty (a fairly close guess), with his dark hair
already streaked with grey about the temples: with a fair complexion,
just tinged with faintest olive: eyes large, clear, and grey, and nose
strong and well-cut, mouth full and rather broad, and chin pointed,
though not prominent: about the medium height, strong in the shoulders,
but <a name="page162" id="page162">slender</a> at the waist, with
movements expressive of a combination of vigour and elasticity.
With due allowance for the passage of five-and-thirty years, this
description would not be inaccurate of Browning the septuagenarian.</p>

<p>They did not return direct to Italy after all, but wintered in Paris
with Robert Browning the elder, who had retired to a small house in a
street leading off the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es. The pension he drew from the Bank
of England was a small one, but, with what he otherwise had, was
sufficient for him to live in comfort. The old gentleman's health was
superb to the last, for he died in 1866 without ever having known a
day's illness.</p>

<p>Spring came out and found them still in Paris, Mrs. Browning
enthusiastic about Napoleon III. and interested in spiritualism: her
husband serenely sceptical concerning both. In the summer they again
went to London: but they appear to have seen more of Kenyon and other
intimate friends than to have led a busy social life. Kenyon's
friendship and good company never ceased to have a charm for both poets.
Mrs. Browning loved him almost as a brother: her husband told Bayard
Taylor, on the day when that good poet and charming man called upon
them, and after another visitor had departed--a man with a large rosy
face and rotund body, as Taylor describes him--"there goes one of the
most splendid men living--a man so noble in his friendship, so lavish in
his hospitality, so large-hearted and benevolent, that he deserves to be
known all over the world as Kenyon the Magnificent."</p>

<p>In the early autumn a sudden move towards Italy was again made, and
after a few weeks in Paris and on the <a name="page163" id="page163">way</a>
the Brownings found themselves at home once more in Casa Guidi.</p>

<p>But before this, probably indeed before they had left Paris for London,
Mr. Moxon had published the now notorious Shelley forgeries. These were
twenty-five spurious letters, but so cleverly manufactured that they at
first deceived many people. In the preceding November Browning had been
asked to write an introduction to them. This he had gladly agreed to do,
eager as he was for a suitable opportunity of expressing his admiration
for Shelley. When the letters reached him, he found that, genuine or
not, though he never suspected they were forgeries, they contained
nothing of particular import, nothing that afforded a just basis for
what he had intended to say. Pledged as he was, however, to write
something for Mr. Moxon's edition of the Letters, he set about the
composition of an Essay, of a general as much as of an individual
nature. This he wrote in Paris, and finished by the beginning of
December. It dealt with the objective and subjective poet; on the
relation of the latter's life to his work; and upon Shelley in the light
of his nature, art, and character. Apart from the circumstance that it
is the only independent prose writing of any length from Browning's pen,
this is an exceptionally able and interesting production.</p>

<p>Dr. Furnivall deserves general gratitude for his obtaining the author's
leave to re-issue it, and for having published it as one of the papers
of the Browning Society. As that enthusiastic student and good friend of
the poet says in his "foretalk" to the reprint, the essay is noteworthy,
not merely as a signal <a name="page164" id="page164">service</a> to
Shelley's fame and memory, but for Browning's statement of his own aim
in his own work, both as objective and subjective poet. The same
clear-sightedness and impartial sympathy, which are such distinguishing
characteristics of his dramatic studies of human thought and emotion,
are obvious in Browning's Shelley essay. "It would be idle to enquire,"
he writes, "of these two kinds of poetic faculty in operation, which is
the higher or even rarer endowment. If the subjective might seem to be
the ultimate requirement of every age, the objective in the strictest
state must still retain its original value. For it is with this world,
as starting-point and basis alike, that we shall always have to concern
ourselves; the world is not to be learned and thrown aside, but reverted
to and reclaimed."</p>

<p>Of its critical subtlety--the more remarkable as by a poet-critic who
revered Shelley the poet and loved and believed in Shelley the man--the
best example, perhaps, is in those passages where he alludes to the
charge against the poet's moral nature--"charges which, if substantiated
to their wide breadth, would materially disturb, I do not deny, our
reception and enjoyment of his works, however wonderful the artistic
qualities of these. For we are not sufficiently supplied with instances
of genius of his order to be able to pronounce certainly how many of its
constituent parts have been tasked and strained to the production of a
given lie, and how high and pure a mood of the creative mind may be
dramatically simulated as the poet's habitual and exclusive one."</p>

<p>The large charity, the liberal human sympathy, the keen critical acumen
of this essay, make one wish that <a name="page165" id="page165">the</a>
author had spared us a "Sludge the Medium" or a "Pacchiarotto," or even a
"Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau," and given us more of such honourable work
in "the other harmony."</p>

<p>Glad as the Brownings were to be home again at Casa Guidi, they could
not enjoy the midsummer heats of Florence, and so went to the Baths of
Lucca. It was a delight for them to ramble among the chestnut-woods of
the high Tuscan forests, and to go among the grape-vines where the
sunburnt vintagers were busy. Once Browning paid a visit to that remote
hill-stream and waterfall, high up in a precipitous glen, where, more
than three-score years earlier, Shelley had been wont to amuse himself
by sitting naked on a rock in the sunlight, reading <i>Herodotus</i> while
he cooled, and then plunging into the deep pool beneath him--to emerge,
further up stream, and then climb through the spray of the waterfall
till he was like a glittering human wraith in the middle of a dissolving
rainbow.</p>

<p>Those Tuscan forests, that high crown of Lucca, must always have special
associations for lovers of poetry. Here Shelley lived, rapt in his
beautiful dreams, and translated the <i>Symposium</i> so that his wife
might share something of his delight in Plato. Here, ten years later, Heine
sneered, and laughed and wept, and sneered again--drank tea with "la
belle Irlandaise," flirted with Francesca "la ballerina," and wrote
alternately with a feathered quill from the breast of a nightingale and
with a lancet steeped in aquafortis: and here, a quarter of a century
afterward, Robert and Elizabeth Browning also laughed and wept and
"joyed <a name="page166" id="page166">i'</a> the sun," dreamed many dreams,
and touched chords of beauty whose vibration has become incorporated with
the larger rhythm of all that is high and enduring in our literature.</p>

<p>On returning to Florence (Browning with the MS. of the greater part of
his splendid fragmentary tragedy, "In a Balcony," composed mainly while
walking alone through the forest glades), Mrs. Browning found that the
chill breath of the <i>tramontana</i> was affecting her lungs, so a move
was made to Rome, for the passing of the winter (1853-4). In the spring
their little boy, their beloved "Pen,"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref22" id="fnref22" href="#fn22">[22]</a></span>
became ill with malaria. This delayed their return to Florence till well
on in the summer. During this stay in Rome Mrs. Browning rapidly
proceeded with "Aurora Leigh," and Browning wrote several of his
"Men and Women," including the exquisite 'Love among the Ruins,' with
its novel metrical music; 'Fra Lippo Lippi,' where the painter, already
immortalised by Landor, has his third warrant of perpetuity; the 'Epistle
of Karshish' (in part); 'Memorabilia' (composed on the Campagna); 'Saul,'
a portion of which had been written and published ten years previously,
that noble and lofty utterance, with its trumpet-like note of the
<a name="page167" id="page167">regnant</a> spirit; the concluding part
of "In a Balcony;" and 'Holy Cross Day'--besides, probably, one or two
others. In the late spring (April 27th) also, he wrote the short dactylic
lyric, 'Ben Karshook's Wisdom.' This little poem was given to a friend for
appearance in one of the then popular <i>Keepsakes</i>--literally given,
for Browning never contributed to magazines. The very few exceptions to
this rule were the result of a kindliness stronger than scruple: as when
(1844), at request of Lord Houghton (then Mr. Monckton Milnes), he sent
'Tokay,' the 'Flower's Name,' and 'Sibrandus Schafnaburgensis,' to "help
in making up some magazine numbers for poor Hood, then at the point of
death from hemorrhage of the lungs, occasioned by the enlargement of the
heart, which had been brought on by the wearing excitement of ceaseless and
excessive literary toil." As 'Ben Karshook's Wisdom,' though it has been
reprinted in several quarters, will not be found in any volume of
Browning's works, and was omitted from "Men and Women" by accident, and
from further collections by forgetfulness, it may be fitly quoted here.
Karshook, it may be added, is the Hebraic word for a thistle.</p>

So-called, it is asserted, from his childish effort to
pronounce a difficult name (Wiedemann). But despite the good authority
for this statement, it is impossible not to credit rather the
explanation given by Nathaniel Hawthorne, who, moreover, affords the
practically definite proof that the boy was at first, as a term of
endearment, called "Pennini," which was later abbreviated to "Pen." The
cognomen, Hawthorne states, was a diminutive of "Apennino," which was
bestowed upon the boy in babyhood because he was very small, there being
a statue in Florence of colossal size called "Apennino."
</div>

<p>It was in this year (1855) that "Men and Women" was published. It is
difficult to understand how a collection comprising poems such as "Love
among the Ruins," "Evelyn Hope," "Fra Lippo Lippi," "A Toccata of
Galuppi's," "Any Wife to any Husband," "Master Hugues of Saxe-Gotha,"
"Andrea del Sarto," "In a Balcony," "Saul," "A Grammarian's Funeral," to
mention only ten now almost universally known, did not at once obtain a
national popularity for the author. But lovers of literature were simply
enthralled: and the two volumes had a welcome from them which was
perhaps all the more ardent because of their disproportionate numbers.
Ears alert to novel poetic music must have thrilled to the new strain
which sounded first--"Love among the Ruins," with its Millet-like
opening--</p>

</div>

<p>Soon after the return to Florence, which, hot as it was, was preferable
in July to Rome, Mrs. Browning wrote to her frequent correspondent Miss
Mitford, and mentioned that about four thousand lines of "Aurora Leigh"
had been written. She added a significant passage: that her husband had
not seen a single line of it up to that time--significant, as one of the
several indications that the union of Browning and his wife was indeed a
marriage of true minds, wherein nothing of the common bane of
matrimonial life found existence. Moreover, both were artists, and,
therefore, too full of respect for themselves and their art to bring in
any way the undue influence of each other into play.</p>

<p>By the spring of 1856, however, the first six "books" were concluded:
and these, at once with humility and pride, Mrs. Browning placed in her
husband's hands. The remaining three books were written, in the summer,
in John Kenyon's London house.</p>

<p>It was her best, her fullest answer to the beautiful dedicatory poem,
"One Word More," wherewith her husband, a few months earlier, sent forth
his "Men and Women," to be for ever associated with "E.B.B."</p>

<p>The transference from Florence to London was made in May. In the summer
"Aurora Leigh" was published, and met with an almost unparalleled
success: even Landor, most exigent of critics, declared that he was
"half drunk with it," that it had an imagination germane to that of
Shakspere, and so forth.</p>

<p>The poem was dedicated to Kenyon, and on their homeward way the
Brownings were startled and shocked to hear of his sudden death. By the
time they had arrived at Casa Guidi again they learned that their good
friend had not forgotten them in the disposition of his large fortune.
To Browning he bequeathed six thousand, to Mrs. Browning four thousand
guineas. This loss was followed early in the ensuing year (1857) by the
death of Mr. Barrett, steadfast to the last in his refusal of
reconciliation with his daughter.</p>

<p>Winters and summers passed happily in Italy--with one period of feverish
anxiety, when the little boy lay for six weeks dangerously ill, nursed
day and night by his father and mother alternately--with pleasant
occasionings, as the companionship for a season of Nathaniel
<a name="page171" id="page171">Hawthorne</a> and his family, or of
weeks spent at Siena with valued and lifelong friends, W.W. Story,
the poet-sculptor, and his wife.</p>

<p>So early as 1858 Mrs. Hawthorne believed she saw the heralds of death in
Mrs. Browning's excessive pallor and the hectic flush upon the cheeks,
in her extreme fragility and weakness, and in her catching, fluttering
breath. Even the motion of a visitor's fan perturbed her. But "her soul
was mighty, and a great love kept her on earth a season longer. She was
a seraph in her flaming worship of heart." "She lives so ardently," adds
Mrs. Hawthorne, "that her delicate earthly vesture must soon be burnt up
and destroyed by her soul of pure fire."</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding, she still sailed the seas of life, like one of
those fragile argonauts in their shells of foam and rainbow-mist which
will withstand the rude surge of winds and waves. But slowly, gradually,
the spirit was o'erfretting its tenement. With the waning of her
strength came back the old passionate longing for rest, for quiescence
from that "excitement from within," which had been almost over vehement
for her in the calm days of her unmarried life.</p>

<p>It is significant that at this time Browning's genius was relatively
dormant. Its wings were resting for the long-sustained flight of "The
Ring and the Book," and for earlier and shorter though not less royal
aerial journeyings. But also, no doubt, the prolonged comparatively
unproductive period of eight or nine years (1855-1864), between the
publication of "Men and Women" and "Dramatis Person&aelig;," was due in some
measure to the poet's incessant and anxious care for his wife, to the
deep sorrow of witnessing her slow but <a name="page172" id="page172">visible</a>
passing away, and to the profound grief occasioned by her death. However,
barrenness of imaginative creative activity can be only very relatively
affirmed, even of so long a period, of years wherein were written such
memorable and treasurable poems as 'James Lee's Wife,' among Browning's
writings what 'Maud' is among Lord Tennyson's; 'Gold Hair: a Legend of
Pornic;' 'Dis Aliter Visum;' 'Abt Vogler,' the most notable production
of its kind in the language; 'A Death in the Desert,' that singular and
impressive study; 'Caliban upon Setebos,' in its strange potency of
interest and stranger poetic note, absolutely unique; 'Youth and Art;'
'Apparent Failure;' 'Prospice,' that noble lyrical defiance of death;
and the supremely lofty and significant series of weighty stanzas,
'Rabbi Ben Ezra,' the most quintessential of all the distinctively psychical
monologues which Browning has written. It seems to me that if these two
poems only, "Prospice" and "Rabbi Ben Ezra," were to survive to the day
of Macaulay's New Zealander, the contemporaries of that meditative
traveller would have sufficient to enable them to understand the great
fame of the poet of "dim ancestral days," as the more acute among them
could discern something of the real Shelley, though time had preserved
but the three lines--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Yet now despair itself is mild,<br />
      Even as the winds and waters are;<br />
      I could lie down like a tired child" . . .</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">something of the real Catullus, through the mists of
remote antiquity, if there had not perished the single passionate cry--</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p class="quote"><span class="in11"><a name="page173" id="page173">"Lesbia illa,</a></span><br />
      Illa Lesbia, quam Catullus unam<br />
      Plus quam se, atque suos amavit omnes!"</p>
</div>

<p>At the beginning of July (1858), the Brownings left Florence for the
summer and autumn, and by easy stages travelled to Normandy. Here the
invalid benefited considerably at first: and here, I may add, Browning
wrote his 'Legend of Pornic,' 'Gold-Hair.' This poem of twenty-seven
five-line stanzas (which differs only from that in more recent
"Collected Works," and "Selections," in its lack of the three stanzas
now numbered xxi., xxii., and xxiii.) was printed for limited private
circulation, though primarily for the purpose of securing American
copyright. Browning several times printed single poems thus, and for the
same reasons--that is, either for transatlantic copyright, or when the
verses were not likely to be included in any volume for a prolonged
period. These leaflets or half-sheetlets of 'Gold Hair' and 'Prospice,'
of 'Cleon' and 'The Statue and the Bust'--together with the "Two Poems
by Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning," published, for benefit of a
charity, in 1854--are among the rarest "finds" for the collector, and
are literally worth a good deal more than their weight in gold.</p>

<p>In the tumultuous year of 1859 all Italy was in a ferment. No patriot
among the Nationalists was more ardent in her hopes than the delicate,
too fragile, dying poetess, whose flame of life burned anew with the
great hopes that animated her for her adopted country. Well indeed did
she deserve, among the lines which the poet Tommaseo wrote and the
Florence municipality caused to be engraved in gold upon a white marble
slab, to be <a name="page174" id="page174">placed</a> upon Casa Guidi,
the words <i>fece del suo verso aureo anello fra Italia e
Inghilterra</i>--"who of her Verse made a golden link connecting
England and Italy."</p>

<p>The victories of Solferino and San Martino made the bitterness of the
disgraceful Treaty of Villafranca the more hard to bear. Even had we not
Mr. Story's evidence, it would be a natural conclusion that this
disastrous ending to the high hopes of the Italian patriots accelerated
Mrs. Browning's death. The withdrawal of hope is often worse in its
physical effects than any direct bodily ill.</p>

<p>It was a miserable summer for both husband and wife, for more private
sorrows also pressed upon them. Not even the sweet autumnal winds
blowing upon Siena wafted away the shadow that had settled upon the
invalid: nor was there medicine for her in the air of Rome, where the
winter was spent. A temporary relief, however, was afforded by the more
genial climate, and in the spring of 1860 she was able, with Browning's
help, to see her Italian patriotic poems through the press. It goes
without saying that these "Poems before Congress" had a grudging
reception from the critics, because they dared to hint that all was not
roseate-hued in England. The true patriots are those who love despite
blemishes, not those who cherish the blemishes along with the virtues.
To hint at a flaw is "not to be an Englishman."</p>

<p>The autumn brought a new sadness in the death of Miss Arabella
Barrett--a dearly loved sister, the "Arabel" of so many affectionate
letters. Once more a winter in Rome proved temporally restorative. But
at last the day came when she wrote her last poem--"North and South," a
gracious welcome to Hans Christian <a name="page175" id="page175">Andersen</a>
on the occasion of his first visit to the Eternal City.</p>

<p>Early in June of 1861 the Brownings were once more at Casa Guidi. But
soon after their return the invalid caught a chill. For a few days she
hovered like a tired bird--though her friends saw only the seemingly
unquenchable light in the starry eyes, and did not anticipate the
silence that was soon to be.</p>

<p>By the evening of the 28th day of the month she was in sore peril of
failing breath. All night her husband sat by her, holding her hand. Two
hours before dawn she realised that her last breath would ere long fall
upon his tear-wet face. Then, as a friend has told us, she passed into a
state of ecstasy: yet not so rapt therein but that she could whisper
many words of hope, even of joy. With the first light of the new day,
she leaned against her lover. Awhile she lay thus in silence, and then,
softly sighing "<i>It is beautiful!</i>" passed like the windy fragrance of
a flower.</p>

<hr class="long" />

<h2><a name="page176" id="page176">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p>It is needless to dwell upon what followed. The world has all that need
be known. To Browning himself it was the abrupt, the too deeply
pathetic, yet not wholly unhappy ending of a lovelier poem than any he
or another should ever write, the poem of their married life.</p>

<p>There is a rare serenity in the thought of death when it is known to be
the gate of life. This conviction Browning had, and so his grief was
rather that of one whose joy has westered earlier. The sweetest music of
his life had withdrawn: but there was still music for one to whom life
in itself was a happiness. He had his son, and was not void of other
solace: but even had it been otherwise he was of the strenuous natures
who never succumb, nor wish to die--whatever accident of mortality
overcome the will and the power.</p>

<p>It was in the autumn following his wife's death that he wrote the noble
poem to which allusion has already been made: "Prospice." Who does not
thrill to its close, when all of gloom or terror</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Shall change, shall become first a peace out of pain,<br />
     <span class="in5">Then a light, then thy breast,</span><br />
       O thou soul of my soul! I shall clasp thee again,<br />
     <span class="in5">And with God be the rest."</span></p>
</div>

<p><a name="page177" id="page177">There</a> are few direct allusions to
his wife in Browning's poems. Of those prior to her death the most
beautiful is "One Word More," which has been already quoted in part:
of the two or three subsequent to that event none surpasses the magic
close of the first part of "The Ring and the Book."</p>

<p>Thereafter the details of his life are public property. He all along
lived in the light, partly from his possession of that serenity which
made Goethe glad to be alive and to be able to make others share in that
gladness. No poet has been more revered and more loved. His personality
will long be a stirring tradition. In the presence of his simple
manliness and wealth of all generous qualities one is inclined to pass
by as valueless, as the mere flying spray of the welcome shower, the
many honours and gratifications that befell him. Even if these things
mattered, concerning one by whose genius we are fascinated, while
undazzled by the mere accidents pertinent thereto, their recital would
be wearisome--of how he was asked to be Lord Rector of this University,
or made a doctor of laws at that: of how letters and tributes of all
kinds came to him from every district in our Empire, from every country
in the world: and so forth. All these things are implied in the
circumstance that his life was throughout "a noble music with a golden
ending."</p>

<p>In 1866 his father died in Paris, strenuous in life until the very end.
After this event Miss Sarianna Browning went to reside with her brother,
and from that time onward was his inseparable companion, and ever one of
the dearest and most helpful of friends. In latter years brother and
sister were constantly seen <a name="page178" id="page178">together</a>,
and so regular attendants were they at such functions as the "Private
Views" at the Royal Academy and Grosvenor Gallery, that these never
seemed complete without them. A Private View, a first appearance of
Joachim or Sarasate, a first concert of Richter or Henschel or Hall&eacute;,
at each of these, almost to a certainty, the poet was sure to appear.
The chief personal happiness of his later life was in his son.
Mr. R. Barrett Browning is so well known as a painter and sculptor
that it would be superfluous for me to add anything further here,
except to state that his successes were his father's keenest pleasures.</p>

<p>Two years after his father's death, that is in 1868, the "Poetical Works
of Robert Browning, M.A., Honorary Fellow of Baliol College, Oxford,"
were issued in six volumes. Here the equator of Browning's genius may be
drawn. On the further side lie the "Men and Women" of the period
anterior to "The Ring and the Book": midway is the transitional zone
itself: on the hither side are the "Men and Women" of a more temperate
if not colder clime.</p>

<p>The first part of "The Ring and the Book" was not published till
November. In September the poet was staying with his sister and son at
Le Croisic, a picturesque village at the mouth of the Loire, at the end
of the great salt plains which stretch down from Gu&eacute;rande to the Bay of
Biscay. No doubt, in lying on the sand-dunes in the golden September
glow, in looking upon the there somewhat turbid current of the Loire,
the poet brooded on those days when he saw its inland waters with her
who was with him no longer save in dreams and memories. Here he wrote
that stirring poem, "Herv&eacute; Riel," founded upon the valorous action of a
French sailor who frustrated the naval might of England, and claimed
nothing as a reward save permission to have a holiday on land to spend a
few hours with his wife, "la belle Aurore." "Herv&eacute;
<a name="page179" id="page179">Riel</a>" (which has been
translated into French, and is often recited, particularly in the
maritime towns, and is always evocative of enthusiastic applause) is one
of Browning's finest action-lyrics, and is assured of the same
immortality as "How they brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix," or
the "Pied Piper" himself.</p>

<p>In 1872 there was practical proof of the poet's growing popularity.
Baron Tauchnitz issued two volumes of excellently selected poems,
comprising some of the best of "Men and Women," "Dramatis Person&aelig;," and
"Dramatic Romances," besides the longer "Soul's Tragedy," "Luria," "In a
Balcony," and "Christmas Eve and Easter Day"--the most Christian poem of
the century, according to one eminent cleric, the heterodox
self-sophistication of a free-thinker, according to another: really, the
reflex of a great crisis, that of the first movement of the tide of
religious thought to a practically limitless freedom. This edition also
contained "Bishop Blougram," then much discussed, apart from its poetic
and intellectual worth, on account of its supposed verisimilitude in
portraiture of Cardinal Wiseman. This composition, one of Browning's
most characteristic, is so clever that it is scarcely a poem. Poetry and
Cleverness do not well agree, the muse being already united in perfect
marriage to Imagination. In his Essay on Truth, Bacon says that one of
the Fathers called poetry <i>Vinum D&aelig;monum</i>, because it filleth the
<a name="page180" id="page180">imagination</a>. Certainly if it be not
<i>vinum d&aelig;monum</i> it is not Poetry.</p>

<p>In this year also appeared the first series of "Selections" by the
poet's latest publishers: "Dedicated to Alfred Tennyson. In
Poetry--illustrious and consummate: In Friendship--noble and sincere."
It was in his preface to this selection that he wrote the often-quoted
words: "Nor do I apprehend any more charges of being wilfully obscure,
unconscientiously careless, or perversely harsh." At or about the date
of these "Selections" the poet wrote to a friend, on this very point of
obscurity, "I can have little doubt that my writing has been in the main
too hard for many I should have been pleased to communicate with; but I
never designedly tried to puzzle people, as some of my critics have
supposed. On the other hand, I never pretended to offer such literature
as should be a substitute for a cigar or a game at dominoes to an idle
man. So perhaps, on the whole, I get my deserts, and something over--not
a crowd, but a few I value more."</p>

<p>In 1877 Browning, ever restless for pastures new, went with his sister
to spend the autumn at La Saisiaz (Savoyard for "the sun"), a villa
among the mountains near Geneva; this time with the additional company
of Miss Anne Egerton Smith, an intimate and valued friend. But there was
an unhappy close to the holiday. Miss Smith died on the night of the
fourteenth of September, from heart complaint. "La Saisiaz" is the
direct outcome of this incident, and is one of the most beautiful of
Browning's later poems. Its trochaics move with a tide-like sound.</p>

<p>At the close, there is a line which might stand as epitaph for the
poet--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote"><a name="page181" id="page181">"He</a>, at least, believed in Soul, was very sure of God."</p>
</div>

<p>In the following year "La Saisiaz" was published along with "The Two
Poets of Croisic," which was begun and partly written at the little
French village ten years previously. There is nothing of the eight-score
stanzas of the "Two Poets" to equal its delightful epilogue, or the
exquisite prefatory lyric, beginning</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Such a starved bank of moss<br />
     <span class="in1">Till that May-morn</span><br />
      Blue ran the flash across:<br />
     <span class="in1">Violets were born."</span></p>
</div>

<p>Extremely interesting--and for myself I cannot find "The Two Poets of
Croisic" to be anything more than "interesting"--it is as a poem
distinctly inferior to "La Saisiaz." Although detached lines are often
far from truly indicative of the real poetic status of a long poem,
where proportion and harmony are of more importance than casual
exfoliations of beauty, yet to a certain extent they do serve as musical
keys that give the fundamental tone. One certainly would have to search
in vain to find in the Croisic poem such lines as</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Five short days, scarce enough to<br />
      Bronze the clustered wilding apple, redden ripe the mountain ash."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or these of Mont Blanc, seen at sunset, towering over
icy pinnacles and teeth-like peaks,</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p class="quote">"Blanc, supreme above his earth-brood, needles red and white and<br />
    <span class="in2">green,</span><br />
     Horns of silver, fangs of crystal set on edge in his demesne."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or, again, this of the sun swinging himself above the dark shoulder of
Jura--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"<a name="page182" id="page182">Gay</a> he hails her, and magnific, thrilled her black length burns to
     <span class="in2">gold."</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or, finally, this sounding verse--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Past the city's congregated peace of homes and pomp of spires."</p>
</div>

<p>The other poems later than "The Ring and the Book" are, broadly
speaking, of two kinds. On the one side may be ranged the groups which
really cohere with "Men and Women." These are "The Inn Album," the
miscellaneous poems of the "Pacchiarotto" volume, the "Dramatic Idyls,"
some of "Jocoseria," and some of "Asolando." "Ferishtah's Fancies" and
"Parleyings" are not, collectively, dramatic poems, but poems of
illuminative insight guided by a dramatic imagination.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref23" id="fnref23" href="#fn23">[23]</a></span>
They, and the classical poems and translations (renderings, rather, by one
whose own individuality dominates them to the exclusion of that
<i>nearness</i> of the original author, which it should be the primary
aim of the translator to evoke), the beautiful "Balaustion's Adventure,"
"Aristophanes' Apology," and "The Agamemnon of Aeschylus," and the third
group, which comprises "Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau," "Red Cotton Nightcap
<a name="page183" id="page183">Country</a>," and
"Fifine at the Fair"--these three groups are of the second kind.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn23" id="fn23" href="#fnref23">[23]</a></span>
In a letter to a friend, Browning wrote:--"I hope and
believe that one or two careful readings of the Poem [Ferishtah's
Fancies] will make its sense clear enough. Above all, pray allow for the
Poet's inventiveness in any case, and do not suppose there is more than
a thin disguise of a few Persian names and allusions. There was no such
person as Ferishtah--the stories are all inventions. ... The Hebrew
quotations are put in for a purpose, as a direct acknowledgment that
certain doctrines may be found in the Old Book, which the Concocters of
Novel Schemes of Morality put forth as discoveries of their own."
</div>

<p>Remarkable as are the three last-named productions, it is extremely
doubtful if the first and second will be read for pleasure by readers
born after the close of this century. As it is impossible, in my narrow
limits, to go into any detail about poems which personally I do not
regard as essential to the truest understanding of Browning, the truest
because on the highest level, that of poetry--as distinct from dogma, or
intellectual suasion of any kind that might, for all its &aelig;sthetic charm,
be in prose--it would be presumptuous to assert anything derogatory of
them without attempting adequate substantiation. I can, therefore,
merely state my own opinion. To reiterate, it is that, for different
reasons, these three long poems are foredoomed to oblivion--not, of
course, to be lost to the student of our literature and of our age, a
more wonderful one even than that of the Renaissance, but to lapse from
the general regard. That each will for a long time find appreciative
readers is certain. They have a fascination for alert minds, and they
have not infrequent ramifications which are worth pursuing for the
glimpses afforded into an always evanishing Promised Land. "Prince
Hohenstiel-Schwangau" (the name, by the way, is not purely fanciful,
being formed from Hohen Schwangau, one of the castles of the late King
of Bavaria) is Browning's complement to his wife's "Ode to Napoleon
III." "Red Cotton Nightcap Country" is a true story, the narrative of
the circumstances pertinent to the tragic death of one Antonio Mellerio,
a Paris jeweller, which occurred in 1870 at St. Aubin in Normandy,
where, <a name="page184" id="page184">indeed</a>, the poet first heard of
it in all its details. It is a story which, if the method of poetry and
the method of prose could for a moment be accepted as equivalent, might
be said to be of the school of a light and humorously grotesque Zola. It
has the fundamental weakness of "The Ring and the Book"--the weakness of
an inadequate ethical basis. It is, indeed, to that great work what a
second-rate novelette is to a masterpiece of fiction.</p>

<p>"Fifine at the Fair," on the other hand, is so powerful and often so
beautiful a poem that one would be rash indeed were he, with the blithe
critical assurance which is so generally snuffed out like a useless
candle by a later generation, to prognosticate its inevitable seclusion
from the high place it at present occupies in the estimate of the poet's
most uncompromising admirers. But surely equally rash is the assertion
that it will be the "poem of the future." However, our concern is not
with problematical estimates, but with the poem as it appears to <i>us</i>.
It is one of the most characteristic of Browning's productions. It would
be impossible for the most indolent reader or critic to attribute it,
even if anonymous, to another parentage. Coleridge alludes somewhere to
certain verses of Wordsworth's, with the declaration that if he had met
them howling in the desert he would have recognised their authorship.
"Fifine" would not even have to howl.</p>

<p>Browning was visiting Pornic one autumn, when he saw the gipsy who was
the original of "Fifine." In the words of Mrs. Orr, "his fancy was
evidently set roaming by the gipsy's audacity, her strength--the
contrast which she presented to the more spiritual types of womanhood;
<a name="page185" id="page185">and</a> this contrast eventually found
expression in a pathetic theory of life, in which these opposite types
and their corresponding modes of attraction became the necessary
complement of each other. As he laid down the theory, Mr. Browning
would be speaking in his own person. But he would turn into some one
else in the act of working it out--for it insensibly carried with it
a plea for yielding to those opposite attractions, not only successively,
but at the same time; and a modified Don Juan would grow up under his pen."</p>

<p>One drawback to an unconditional enjoyment of Balzac is that every now
and again the student of the <i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i> resents the too obvious
display of the forces that propel the effect--a lesser phase of the
weariness which ensues upon much reading of the mere "human documents"
of the Goncourt school of novelists. In the same way, we too often see
Browning working up the electrical qualities, so that, when the
fulmination comes, we understand "just how it was produced," and, as
illogically as children before a too elaborate conjurer, conclude that
there is not so much in this particular poetic feat as in others which,
like Herrick's maids, continually do deceive. To me this is affirmable
of "Fifine at the Fair." The poet seems to know so very well what he is
doing. If he did not take the reader so much into his confidence, if he
would rely more upon the liberal grace of his earlier verse and less
upon the trained subtlety of his athletic intellect, the charm would be
the greater. The poem would have a surer duration as one of the author's
greater achievements, if there were more frequent and more prolonged
insistence on the note struck in the lines (&sect; lxxiii.) about the
hill-stream, <a name="page186" id="page186">infant</a> of mist and dew,
falling over the ledge of the fissured cliff to find its fate in smoke
below, as it disappears into the deep, "embittered evermore, to make
the sea one drop more big thereby:" or in the cloudy splendour of the
description of nightfall (&sect; cvi.): or in the windy spring freshness of</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Hence, when the earth began afresh its life in May,<br />
      And fruit-trees bloomed, and waves would wanton, and the bay<br />
      Ruffle its wealth of weed, and stranger-birds arrive,<br />
      And beasts take each a mate." . . .</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But its chief fault seems to me to be its lack of
that transmutive glow of rhythmic emotion without which no poem can endure.
This rhythmic energy is, inherently, a distinct thing from intellectual
emotion. Metric music may be alien to the adequate expression of the latter,
whereas rhythmic emotion can have no other appropriate issue. Of course,
in a sense, all creative art is rhythmic in kind: but here I am speaking
only of that creative energy which evolves the germinal idea through the
medium of language. The energy of the intellect under creative stimulus
may produce lordly issues in prose: but poetry of a high intellectual
order can be the outcome only of an intellect fused to white heat, of
intellectual emotion on fire--as, in the fine saying of George Meredith,
passion is noble strength on fire. Innumerable examples could be taken
from any part of the poem, but as it would not be just to select the
most obviously defective passages, here are two which are certainly
fairly representative of the general level--</p>

<blockquote>
     <p>"And I became aware, scarcely the word escaped my lips, that swift
      ensued in silence and by stealth, and yet with certitude, a
     <a name="page187" id="page187">formidable</a> change of the
      amphitheatre which held the Carnival; <i>although the human stir
      continued just the same amid that shift of scene</i>."
      (No. <span class="small">CV.</span>)</p>

     <p>"And where i' the world is all this wonder, you detail so
      trippingly, espied? My mirror would reflect a tall, thin, pale,
      deep-eyed personage, pretty once, it may be, doubtless still
      loving--certain grace yet lingers if you will--but all this
      wonder, where?" (No. <span class="small">XL.</span>)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here, and in a hundred other such passages, we have the rhythm, if not
of the best prose, at least not that of poetry. Will "Fifine" and poems
of its kind stand re-reading, re-perusal over and over? That is one of
the most definite tests. In the pressure of life can we afford much time
to anything but the very best--nay, to the vast mass even of that which
closely impinges thereupon?</p>

<p>For myself, in the instance of "Fifine," I admit that if re-perusal be
controlled by pleasure I am content (always excepting a few scattered
noble passages) with the Prologue and Epilogue. A little volume of those
Summaries of Browning's--how stimulating a companion it would be in
those hours when the mind would fain breathe a more liberal air!</p>

<p>As for "Jocoseria,"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref24" id="fnref24" href="#fn24">[24]</a></span>
it seems to me the poorest of Browning's works, and I cannot help thinking
that <a name="page188" id="page188">ultimately</a> the only gold grain
discoverable therein will be "Ixion," the beautiful penultimate poem
beginning--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Never the time and the place<br />
        And the loved one altogether;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the thrush-like overture, closing--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"What of the leafage, what of the flower?<br />
      Roses embowering with nought they embower!<br />
      Come then! complete incompletion, O comer,<br />
      Pant through the blueness, perfect the summer!<br />
     <span class="in3">Breathe but one breath</span><br />
     <span class="in3">Rose-beauty above,</span><br />

<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn24" id="fn24" href="#fnref24">[24]</a></span>
In a letter to a friend, along with an early copy of this
book, Browning stated that "the title is taken from the work of Melander
(<i>Schwartzmann</i>), reviewed, by a curious coincidence, in the
<i>Blackwood</i> of this month. I referred to it in a note to 'Paracelsus.'
The two Hebrew quotations (put in to give a grave look to what is mere fun
and invention) being translated amount to (1) 'A Collection of Many Lies':
and (2), an old saying, 'From Moses to Moses arose none like Moses'......"
</div>

<p>In 1881 the "Browning Society" was established. It is easy to ridicule
any institution of the kind--much easier than to be considerate of other
people's earnest convictions and aims, or to be helpful to their object.
There is always a ridiculous side to excessive enthusiasm, particularly
obvious to persons incapable of enthusiasm of any kind. With some
mistakes, and not a few more or less grotesque absurdities, the members
of the various English and American Browning Societies are yet to be
congratulated on the good work they have, collectively, accomplished.
Their publications are most interesting and suggestive: ultimately they
will be invaluable. The members have also done a good work in causing
some of Browning's plays to be produced again on the stage, and in Miss
Alma Murray and others have found sympathetic and able exponents of some
of the poet's most attractive <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>. There can
<a name="page189" id="page189">be</a> no question as to the powerful
impetus given by the Society to Browning's steadily-increasing
popularity. Nothing shows his judicious good sense more than the
letter he wrote, privately, to Mr. Edmund Yates, at the time of the
Society's foundation.</p>

<blockquote>
      <p>"The Browning Society, I need not say, as well as Browning
      himself, are fair game for criticism. I had no more to do with the
      founding it than the babe unborn; and, as Wilkes was no Wilkeite,
      I am quite other than a Browningite. But I cannot wish harm to a
      society of, with a few exceptions, names unknown to me, who are
      busied about my books so disinterestedly. The exaggerations
      probably come of the fifty-years'-long charge of unintelligibility
      against my books; such reactions are possible, though I never
      looked for the beginning of one so soon. That there is a grotesque
      side to the thing is certain; but I have been surprised and
      touched by what cannot but have been well intentioned, I think.
      Anyhow, as I never felt inconvenienced by hard words, you will not
      expect me to wax bumptious because of undue compliment: so enough
      of 'Browning,'--except that he is yours very truly, 'while this
      machine is to him.'"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The latter years of the poet were full of varied interest for himself,
but present little of particular significance for specification in a
monograph so concise as this must perforce be. Every year he went
abroad, to France or to Italy, and once or twice on a yachting trip in
the Mediterranean.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref25" id="fnref25" href="#fn25">[25]</a></span>
At home--for many years, at 19 <a name="page190" id="page190">Warwick</a> Crescent,
in what some one has called the dreary Mesopotamia of Paddington, and
for the last three or four years of his life at 29 De Vere Gardens,
Kensington Gore--his avocations were so manifold that it is difficult to
understand where he had leisure for his vocation. Everybody wished him
to come to dine; and he did his utmost to gratify Everybody. He saw
everything; read all the notable books; kept himself acquainted with the
leading contents of the journals and magazines; conducted a large
correspondence; read new French, German, and Italian books of mark; read
and translated Euripides and &AElig;schylus; knew all the gossip of the
literary clubs, salons, and the studios; was a frequenter of
afternoon-tea parties; and then, over and above it, he was Browning: the
most profoundly subtle mind that has exercised itself in poetry since
Shakspere. His personal grace and charm of manner never failed. Whether
he was dedicating "Balaustion's Adventure" in terms of gracious
courtesy, or handing a flower from some jar of roses, or lilies, or his
favourite daffodils, with a bright smile or merry glance, to the lady of
his regard, or when sending a copy of a new book of poetry with an
accompanying letter expressed with rare felicity, or when generously
prophesying for a young poet the only true success if he will but listen
and act upon "the inner voice,"--he was in all these, and in all things,
the ideal gentleman. There is so charming and characteristic a
<a name="page191" id="page191">touch</a> in
the following note to a girl-friend, that I must find room for it:--</p>

<blockquote>
      <p class="right">29 De Vere Gardens, W.,<br />
      <i>6th July</i> 1889.</p>

      <p><span class="small">MY BELOVED ALMA</span>,--I had the honour yesterday of dining with the
      Shah, whereupon the following dialogue:--</p>

      <p>"Vous êtes poëte?"</p>

      <p>"On s'est permis de me le dire quelquefois."</p>

      <p>"Et vous avez fait des livres?"</p>

      <p>"Trop de livres."</p>

      <p>"Voulez-vous m'en donner un, afin que je puisse me ressouvenir de
      vous?"</p>

      <p>"Avec plaisir."</p>

      <p>I have been accordingly this morning to town, where the thing is
      procurable, and as I chose a volume of which I judged the binding
      might take the imperial eye, I said to myself, "Here do I present
      my poetry to a personage for whom I do not care three straws; why
      should I not venture to do as much for a young lady I love dearly,
      who, for the author's sake, will not impossibly care rather for
      the inside than the outside of the volume?" So I was bold enough
      to take one and offer it for your kind acceptance, begging you to
      remember in days to come that the author, whether a good poet or
      no, was always, my Alma, your affectionate friend,</p>

      <p class="right"><span class="small">ROBERT BROWNING.</span></p>

</blockquote>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn25" id="fn25" href="#fnref25">[25]</a></span>
It was on his first experience of this kind, more than a
quarter of a century earlier, that he wrote the nobly patriotic lines of
"Home Thoughts from the Sea," and that flawless strain of bird-music,
"Home Thoughts from Abroad:" then, also, that he composed "How they
brought the Good News." Concerning the last, he wrote, in 1881 (<i>vide
The Academy</i>, April 2nd), "There is no sort of historical foundation
about [this poem]. I wrote it under the bulwark of a vessel off the
African coast, after I had been at it long enough to appreciate even the
fancy of a gallop on the back of a certain good horse, 'York,' then in
my stable at home. It was written in pencil on the fly-leaf of Bartoli's
<i>Simboli</i>, I remember."
</div>

<p>His look was a continual and serene gleam. Lamartine, who remarks this
of Bossuet in his youth, adds a phrase which, as observant acquaintances
of the poet will agree, might be written of Browning--"His lips quivered
often without utterance, as if with the wind of an internal speech."</p>

<p>Except for the touching and beautiful letter which he wrote from Asolo
about two months before his death, to Mr. Wilfrid Meynell, about a young
writer to whom the latter wished to draw the poet's kindly attention--a
letter which has a peculiar pathos in the <a name="page192" id="page192">words</a>,
"I shall soon depart for Venice, on my way homeward"--except for this
letter there is none so well worth repetition here as his last word to
the Poet-Laureate. The friendship between these two great poets has in
itself the fragrance of genius. The letter was written just before
Browning left London.</p>

      <p class="right">29 De Vere Gardens, W.,<br />
      <i>August 5th</i>, 1889.</p>

      <p><span class="small">MY DEAR TENNYSON</span>,--To-morrow is your
      birthday--indeed, a memorable one. Let me say I associate myself
      with the universal pride of our country in your glory, and in its
      hope that for many and many a year we may have your very self
      among us--secure that your poetry will be a wonder and delight
      to all those appointed to come after. And for my own part, let
      me further say, I have loved you dearly. May God bless you and yours.</p>

      <p>At no moment from first to last of my acquaintance with your
      works, or friendship with yourself, have I had any other feeling,
      expressed or kept silent, than this which an opportunity allows me
      to utter--that I am and ever shall be, my dear Tennyson,
      admiringly and affectionately yours,</p>

      <p class="right"><span class="small">ROBERT BROWNING.</span></p>

<p>Shortly after this he was at Asolo once more, the little hill-town in
the Veneto, which he had visited in his youth, and where he heard again
the echo of Pippa's song--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"God's in His heaven,<br />
      All's right with the world!"</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. W.W. Story writes to me that he spent three days with the poet at
this time, and that the latter seemed, except for a slight asthma, to be
as vigorous in mind and body as ever. Thence, later in the autumn, he
went to Venice, to join his son and daughter-in-law at the home where he
was "to have a corner for his old age," the beautiful Palazzo Rezzonico,
on the Grand Canal. He <a name="page193" id="page193">was</a> never happier,
more sanguine, more joyous, than here. He worked for three or four hours
each morning, walked daily for about two hours, crossed occasionally to
the Lido with his sister, and in the evenings visited friends or went to
the opera. But for some time past, his heart--always phenomenally slow
in its action, and of late ominously intermittent--had been noticeably
weaker. As he suffered no pain and little inconvenience, he paid no
particular attention to the matter. Browning had as little fear of death
as doubt in God. In a controlling Providence he did indeed profoundly
believe. He felt, with Joubert, that "it is not difficult to believe in
God, if one does not worry oneself to define Him."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref26" id="fnref26" href="#fn26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="fn"><span class="fnnum"><a name="fn26" id="fn26" href="#fnref26">[26]</a></span>
"Browning's 'orthodoxy' brought him into many a combat
with his rationalistic friends, some of whom could hardly believe that
he took his doctrine seriously. Such was the fact, however; indeed, I
have heard that he once stopped near an open-air assembly which an
atheist was haranguing, and, in the freedom of his <i>incognito</i>, gave
strenuous battle to the opinions uttered. To one who had spoken of an
expected 'Judgment Day' as a superstition, I heard him say: 'I don't see
that. Why should there not be a settling day in the universe, as when a
master settles with his workmen at the end of the week?' There was
something in his tone and manner which suggested his dramatic conception
of religious ideas and ideals."--<span class="small">MONCURE D. CONWAY</span>.</div>

<p>"How should externals satisfy my soul?" was his cry in "Sordello," and
it was the fundamental strain of all his poetry, as the fundamental
motive is expressible in</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"--a loving worm within its sod<br />
      Were diviner than a loveless god<br />
      Amid his worlds"--</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">love being with him the golden key wherewith to unlock
the world of the universe, of the soul, of all <a name="page194" id="page194">nature</a>.
He is as convinced of the two absolute facts of God and Soul as Cardinal
Newman in writing of "Two and two only, supreme and luminously self-evident
beings, myself and my Creator." Most fervently he believes that</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Haply for us the ideal dawn shall break ...<br />
      And set our pulse in tune with moods divine"--</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">though, co-equally, in the necessity of "making man
sole sponsor of himself." Ever and again, of course, he was betrayed by
the bewildering and defiant puzzle of life: seeing in the face of the
child the seed of sorrow, "in the green tree an ambushed flame, in
Phosphor a vaunt-guard of Night." Yet never of him could be written
that thrilling saying which Sainte-Beuve uttered of Pascal, "That lost
traveller who yearns for home, who, strayed without a guide in a dark
forest, takes many times the wrong road, goes, returns upon his steps,
is discouraged, sits down at a crossing of the roads, utters cries to
which no one responds, resumes his march with frenzy and pain, throws
himself upon the ground and wants to die, and reaches home at last only
after all sorts of anxieties and after sweating blood." No darkness,
no tempest, no gloom, long confused his vision of 'the ideal dawn.'
As the carrier-dove is often baffled, yet ere long surely finds her way
through smoke and fog and din to her far country home, so he too, however
distraught, soon or late soared to untroubled ether. He had that profound
inquietude, which the great French critic says 'attests a moral nature of
a high rank, and a mental nature stamped with the seal of the archangel.'
But, unlike Pascal--who in Sainte-Beuve's words exposes
<a name="page195" id="page195">in</a> the human mind itself
two abysses, "on one side an elevation toward God, toward the morally
beautiful, a return movement toward an illustrious origin, and on the
other side an abasement in the direction of evil"--Browning sees,
believes in, holds to nothing short of the return movement, for one and
all, toward an illustrious origin.</p>

<p>The crowning happiness of a happy life was his death in the city he
loved so well, in the arms of his dear ones, in the light of a
world-wide fame. The silence to which the most eloquent of us must all
one day lapse came upon him like the sudden seductive twilight of the
Tropics, and just when he had bequeathed to us one of his finest
utterances.</p>

<p>It seems but a day or two ago that the present writer heard from the
lips of the dead poet a mockery of death's vanity--a brave assertion of
the glory of life. "Death, death! It is this harping on death I despise
so much," he remarked with emphasis of gesture as well as of speech--the
inclined head and body, the right hand lightly placed upon the
listener's knee, the abrupt change in the inflection of the voice, all
so characteristic of him---"this idle and often cowardly as well as
ignorant harping! Why should we not change like everything else? In
fiction, in poetry, in so much of both, French as well as English, and,
I am told, in American art and literature, the shadow of death--call it
what you will, despair, negation, indifference--is upon us. But what
fools who talk thus! Why, <i>amico mio</i>, you know as well as I that
death is life, just as our daily, our momentarily dying body is none the
less alive and ever recruiting new forces of existence. Without death,
<a name="page196" id="page196">which</a> is our crapelike churchyardy word
for change, for growth, there could be no prolongation of that which we
call life. Pshaw! it is foolish to argue upon such a thing even. For
myself, I deny death as an end of everything. Never say of me that
I am dead!"</p>

<p>On the evening of Thursday, the 12th of December (1889), he was in bed,
with exceeding weakness. In the centre of the lofty ceiling of the room
in which he lay, and where it had been his wont to work, there is a
painting by his son. It depicts an eagle struggling with a serpent, and
is illustrative of a superb passage in Shelley's "Revolt of Islam." What
memories, what deep thoughts, it must have suggested; how significant,
to us, the circumstance! But weak as the poet was, he yet did not see
the shadow which had begun to chill the hearts of the watchers. Shortly
before the great bell of San Marco struck ten, he turned and asked if
any news had come concerning "Asolando," published that day. His son
read him a telegram from the publishers, telling how great the demand
was and how favourable were the advance-articles in the leading papers.
The dying poet smiled and muttered, "How gratifying!" When the last toll
of St. Mark's had left a deeper stillness than before, those by the
bedside saw a yet profounder silence on the face of him whom they loved.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is needless to dwell upon the grief everywhere felt and expressed for
the irreparable loss. The magnificent closing lines of Shelley's
"Alastor" must have occurred to many a mourner; for gone, indeed, was "a
surpassing Spirit." The superb pomp of the Venetian funeral, the
<a name="page197" id="page197">solemn</a> grandeur of the interment in
Westminster Abbey, do not seem worth recording: so insignificant are all
these accidents of death made by the supreme fact itself. Yet it is
fitting to know that Venice has never in modern times afforded a more
impressive sight, than those craped processional gondolas following
the high flower-strewn funeral-barge through the thronged water-ways
and out across the lagoon to the desolate Isle of the Dead: that London
has rarely seen aught more solemn than the fog-dusked Cathedral spaces,
echoing at first with the slow tramp of the pall-bearers, and then with
the sweet aerial music swaying upward the loved familiar words of the
'Lyric Voice' hushed so long before. Yet the poet was as much honoured
by those humble friends, Lambeth artizans and a few poor working-women,
who threw sprays of laurel before the hearse--by that desolate, starving,
woe-weary gentleman, shivering in his threadbare clothes, who seemed
transfixed with a heart-wrung though silent emotion, ere he hurriedly
drew from his sleeve a large white chrysanthemum, and throwing it beneath
the coffin as it was lifted inward, disappeared in the crowd, which closed
again like the sea upon this lost wandering wave.</p>

<p>Who would not honour this mighty dead? All who could be present were
there, somewhere in the ancient Abbey. One of the greatest, loved and
admired by the dead poet, had already put the mourning of many into the
lofty dignity of his verse:--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Now dumb is he who waked the world to speak,<br />
      And voiceless hangs the world beside his bier,<br />
      Our words are sobs, our cry of praise a tear:<br />
      We are the smitten mortal, we the weak.<br />
      <a name="page198" id="page198">We</a> see a spirit on Earth's loftiest peak<br />
      Shine, and wing hence the way he makes more clear:<br />
      See a great Tree of Life that never sere<br />
      Dropped leaf for aught that age or storms might wreak:<br />
      Such ending is not Death: such living shows<br />
      What wide illumination brightness sheds<br />
      From one big heart--to conquer man's old foes:<br />
      The coward, and the tyrant, and the force<br />
      Of all those weedy monsters raising heads<br />
      When Song is murk from springs of turbid source."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref27" id="fnref27" href="#fn27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>One word more of "light and fleeting shadow." In the greatness of his
nature he must be ranked with Milton, Defoe, and Scott. His very
shortcomings, such as they were, were never baneful growths, but mere
weeds, with a certain pleasant though pungent savour moreover, growing
upon a rich, an exuberant soil. Pluck one of the least lovely--rather
call it the unworthy arrow shot at the body of a dead comrade, so
innocent of ill intent: yet it too has a beauty of its own, for the
shaft was aflame from the fulness of a heart whose love had withstood
the chill passage of the years.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the night of Browning's death a new star suddenly appeared in Orion.
The coincidence is suggestive if we like to indulge in the fancy that in
that constellation--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"No more subjected to the change or chance<br />
      Of the unsteady planets----"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">gleam those other "abodes where the Immortals are."
Certainly, a wandering fire has passed away from us.
<a name="page199" id="page199">Whither</a> has it gone? To that
new star in Orion: or whirled to remote silences in the trail of lost
meteors? Whence, and for how long, will its rays reach our storm and
gloom-beleaguered earth?</p>

<p>Such questions cannot meanwhile be solved. Our eyes are still confused
with the light, with that ardent flame, as we knew it here. But this we
know, it was indeed "a central fire descending upon many altars." These,
though touched with but a spark of the immortal principle, bear enduring
testimony. And what testimony! How heartfelt: happily also how
widespread, how electrically stimulative!</p>

<p>But the time must come when the poet's personality will have the
remoteness of tradition: when our perplexed judgments will be as a tale
of sound and fury, signifying nothing. It is impossible for any student
of literature, for any interested reader, not to indulge in some
forecast as to what rank in the poetic hierarchy Robert Browning will
ultimately occupy. The commonplace as to the impossibility of
prognosticating the ultimate slow decadence, or slower rise, or, it may
be, sustained suspension, of a poet's fame, is often insincere, and but
an excuse of indolence. To dogmatise were the height of presumption as
well as of folly: but to forego speculation, based upon complete present
knowledge, for an idle contentment with narrow horizons, were perhaps
foolisher still. But assuredly each must perforce be content with his
own prevision. None can answer yet for the generality, whose decisive
franchise will elect a fit arbiter in due time.</p>

<p>So, for myself, let me summarise what I have already written in several
sections of this book, and particularly <a name="page200" id="page200">in</a>
the closing pages of Chapter VI. There, it will be remembered--after having
found that Browning's highest achievement is in his second period--emphasis
was laid on the primary importance of his life-work in its having compelled
us to the assumption of a fresh critical standpoint involving the construction
of a new definition. In the light of this new definition I think Browning
will ultimately be judged. As the sculptor in "Pippa Passes" was the
predestinated novel thinker in marble, so Browning himself appears as
the predestinated novel thinker in verse; the novel thinker, however, in
degree, not in kind. But I do not for a moment believe that his
greatness is in his status as a thinker: even less, that the poet and
the thinker are indissociable. Many years ago Sainte-Beuve destroyed
this shallow artifice of pseudo-criticism: "Venir nous dire que tout
poëte de talent est, par essence, un grand <i>penseur</i>, et que tout vrai
<i>penseur</i> est n&eacute;cessairement artiste et poëte, c'est une pr&eacute;tention
insoutenable et que d&eacute;ment &agrave; chaque instant la r&eacute;alit&eacute;."</p>

<p>When Browning's enormous influence upon the spiritual and mental life of
our day--an influence ever shaping itself to wise and beautiful
issues--shall have lost much of its immediate import, there will still
surely be discerned in his work a formative energy whose resultant is
pure poetic gain. It is as the poet he will live: not merely as the
"novel thinker in verse." Logically, his attitude as 'thinker' is
unimpressive. It is the attitude, as I think some one has pointed out,
of acquiescence with codified morality. In one of his <i>Causeries</i>, the
keen French critic quoted above has a remark upon the great Bossuet,
which may with singular <a name="page201" id="page201">aptness</a> be
repeated of Browning:--"His is the Hebrew genius extended, fecundated
by Christianity, and open to all the acquisitions of the understanding,
but retaining some degree of sovereign interdiction, and closing its
vast horizon precisely where its light ceases." Browning cannot, or
will not, face the problem of the future except from the basis of
assured continuity of individual existence. He is so much in love with
life, for life's sake, that he cannot even credit the possibility of
incontinuity; his assurance of eternity in another world is at least
in part due to his despair at not
being eternal in this. He is so sure, that the intellectually scrupulous
detect the odours of hypotheses amid the sweet savour of indestructible
assurance. Schopenhauer says, in one of those recently-found Annotations
of his which are so characteristic and so acute, "that which is called
'mathematical certainty' is the cane of a blind man without a dog, or
equilibrium in darkness." Browning would sometimes have us accept the
evidence of his 'cane' as all-sufficient. He does not entrench himself
among conventions: for he already finds himself within the fortified
lines of convention, and remains there. Thus is true what Mr. Mortimer
says in a recent admirable critique--"His position in regard to the
thought of the age is paradoxical, if not inconsistent. He is in advance
of it in every respect but one, the most important of all, the matter of
fundamental principles; in these he is behind it. His processes of
thought are often scientific in their precision of analysis; the sudden
conclusion which he imposes upon them is transcendental and inept."
Browning's conclusions, which harmonise so well with our haphazard
previsionings, are sometimes <a name="page202" id="page202">so</a>
disastrously facile that they exercise an insurrectionary influence.
They occasionally suggest that wisdom of Gotham which is ever ready to
postulate the certainty of a fulfilment because of the existence of a
desire. It is this that vitiates so much of his poetic reasoning. Truth
may ring regnant in the lines of Abt Vogler--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"And what is our failure here but a triumph's evidence<br />
      For the fulness of the days?"--</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but, unfortunately, the conclusion is, in itself, illogical.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with, and in this book I have dwelt more than once
upon, Browning's habitual attitude towards Death. It is not a novel one.
The frontage is not so much that of the daring pioneer, as the sedate
assurance of 'the oldest inhabitant.' It is of good hap, of welcome
significance: none the less there is an aspect of our mortality of which
the poet's evasion is uncompromising and absolute. I cannot do better
than quote Mr. Mortimer's noteworthy words hereupon, in connection,
moreover, with Browning's artistic relation to Sex, that other great
Protagonist in the relentless duel of Humanity with Circumstance. "The
final inductive hazard he declines for himself; his readers may take it
if they will. It is part of the insistent and perverse ingenuity which
we display in masking with illusion the more disturbing elements of
life. Veil after veil is torn down, but seldom before another has been
slipped behind it, until we acquiesce without a murmur in the
concealment that we ourselves have made. Two facts thus carefully
shrouded from full vision by elaborate illusion conspicuously round in
our lives--the life-giving <a name="page203" id="page203">and</a>
life-destroying elements, Sex and Death. We are compelled to occasional
physiologic and economic discussion of the one, but we shrink from
recognising the full extent to which it bases the whole social fabric
carefully concealing its insurrections, and ignoring or misreading their
lessons. The other, in certain aspects, we are compelled to face, but to
do it we tipple on illusions, from our cradle upwards, in dread of the
coming grave, purchasing a drug for our poltroonery at the expense of
our sanity. We uphold our wayward steps with the promises and the
commandments for crutches, but on either side of us trudge the shadow
Death and the bacchanal Sex, and we mumble prayers against the one, while
we scourge ourselves for leering at the other. On one only of these can
Browning be said to have spoken with novel force--the relations of sex,
which he has treated with a subtlety and freedom, and often with a beauty,
unapproached since Goethe. On the problem of Death, except in masquerade
of robes and wings, his eupeptic temperament never allowed him to dwell.
He sentimentalised where Shakspere thought." Browning's whole attitude
to the Hereafter is different from that of Tennyson only in that the
latter 'faintly,' while he strenuously, "trusts the larger hope." To him
all credit, that, standing upon the frontiers of the Past, he can
implicitly trust the Future.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"High-hearted surely he;<br />
      But bolder they who first off-cast<br />
      Their moorings from the habitable Past."</p>
</div>

<p>The teacher may be forgotten, the prophet may be hearkened to no more,
but a great poet's utterance is <a name="page204" id="page204">never</a>
temporal, having that in it which conserves it against the antagonism of
time, and the ebb and flow of literary ideals. What range, what extent of
genius! As Mr. Frederick Wedmore has well said, 'Browning is not a book--he
is a literature.'</p>

<p>But that he will "stand out gigantic" in <i>mass</i> of imperishable work,
in that far-off day, I for one cannot credit. His poetic shortcomings seem
too essential to permit of this. That fatal excess of cold over emotive
thought, of thought that, however profound, incisive, or scrupulously
clear, is not yet impassioned, is a fundamental defect of his. It is the
very impetuosity of this mental energy to which is due the miscalled
obscurity of much of Browning's work--miscalled, because, however remote
in his allusions, however pedantic even, he is never obscure in his
thought. His is that "palace infinite which darkens with excess of
light." But mere excess in itself is nothing more than symptomatic.
Browning has suffered more from intellectual exploitation than any
writer. It is a ruinous process--for the poet. "He so well repays
intelligent study." That is it, unfortunately. There are many, like the
old Scotch lady who attempted to read Carlyle's <i>French Revolution</i>,
who think they have become "daft" when they encounter a passage such as,
for example,</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in9">"Rivals, who . . .</span><br />
      Tuned, from Bocafoli's stark-naked psalms,<br />
      To Plara's sonnets spoilt by toying with,<br />
      'As knops that stud some almug to the pith<br />
      'Prick&egrave;d for gum, wry thence, and crinkled worse<br />
      'Than purs&egrave;d eyelids of a river-horse<br />
      'Sunning himself o' the slime when whirrs the breeze--<br />
     <i>Gad-fly,</i> that is."</p>
</div>

<p><a name="page205" id="page205">The</a> old lady persevered with Carlyle,
and, after a few days, found "she was nae sae daft, but that she had
tackled a varra dee-fee-cult author." What would even that indomitable
student have said to the above quotation, and to the poem whence it comes?
To many it is not the poetry, but the difficulties, that are the attraction.
They rejoice, after long and frequent dippings, to find their plummet,
almost lost in remote depths, touch bottom. Enough 'meaning' has been
educed from 'Childe Roland,' to cite but one instance, to start a School of
Philosophy with: though it so happens that the poem is an imaginative
fantasy, written in one day. Worse still, it was not inspired by the
mystery of existence, but by 'a red horse with a glaring eye standing
behind a dun one on a piece of tapestry that used to hang in the poet's
drawing-room.'<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref28" id="fnref28" href="#fn28">[28]</a></span>
Of all his faults, however, the worst is that
jugglery, that inferior legerdemain, with the elements of the beautiful
in verse: most obvious in "Sordello," in portions of "The Ring and the
Book," and in so many of the later poems. These inexcusable violations
are like the larv&aelig; within certain vegetable growths: soon or late they
will destroy their environment before they perish themselves. Though
possessive above all others of that science of the percipient in the
allied arts of painting and music, wherein he found the unconventional
Shelley so missuaded by convention, he seemed ever more alert to the
substance than to the manner of poetry. In a <a name="page206" id="page206">letter</a>
of Mrs. Browning's she alludes to a friend's "melodious feeling" for poetry.
Possibly the phrase was accidental, but it is significant. To inhale the
vital air of poetry we must love it, not merely find it "interesting,"
"suggestive," "soothing," "stimulative": in a word, we must have a
"melodious feeling" for poetry before we can deeply enjoy it. Browning,
who has so often educed from his lyre melodies and harmonies of transcendent,
though novel, beauty, was too frequently, during composition, without this
melodious feeling of which his wife speaks. The distinction between
literary types such as Browning or Balzac on the one hand, and Keats or
Gustave Flaubert on the other, is that with the former there exists a
reverence for the vocation and a relative indifference to the means, in
themselves--and, with the latter, a scrupulous respect for the mere
means as well as for that to which they conduce. The poet who does not
love words for themselves, as an artist loves any chance colour upon his
palette, or as the musician any vagrant tone evoked by a sudden touch in
idleness or reverie, has not entered into the full inheritance of the
sons of Apollo. The writer cannot aim at beauty, that which makes
literature and art, without this heed--without, rather, this creative
anxiety: for it is certainly not enough, as some one has said, that
language should be used merely for the transportation of intelligence,
as a wheelbarrow carries brick. Of course, Browning is not persistently
neglectful of this fundamental necessity for the literary artist. He is
often as masterly in this as in other respects. But he is not always,
not often enough, alive to the paramount need. He writes with "the verse
being as the mood it paints:" but, unfortunately, the
<a name="page207" id="page207">mood</a> is often
poetically unformative. He had no passion for the quest for seductive
forms. Too much of his poetry has been born prematurely. Too much of it,
indeed, has not died and been born again--for all immortal verse is a
poetic resurrection. Perfect poetry is the deathless part of mortal
beauty. The great artists never perpetuate gross actualities, though
they are the supreme realists. It is Schiller, I think, who says in
effect, that to live again in the serene beauty of art, it is needful
that things should first die in reality. Thus Browning's dramatic
method, even, is sometimes disastrous in its untruth, as in Caliban's
analytical reasoning--an initial absurdity, as Mr. Berdoe has pointed
out, adding epigrammatically, 'Caliban is a savage, with the
introspective powers of a Hamlet, and the theology of an evangelical
Churchman.' Not only Caliban, but several other of Browning's personages
(Aprile, Eglamour, etc.) are what Goethe calls <i>schwankende
Gestalten</i>, mere "wavering images."</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn28" id="fn28" href="#fnref28">[28]</a></span>
One account says 'Childe Roland' was written in three
days; another, that it was composed in one. Browning's rapidity in
composition was extraordinary. "The Return of the Druses" was written in
five days, an act a day; so, also, was the "Blot on the 'Scutcheon."
</div>

<p>Montaigne, in one of his essays, says that to stop gracefully is sure
proof of high race in a horse: certainly to stop in time is imperative
upon the poet. Of Browning may be said what Poe wrote of another, that
his genius was too impetuous for the minuter technicalities of that
elaborate <i>art</i> so needful in the building up of monuments for
immortality. But has not a greater than Poe declared that "what
distinguishes the artist from the amateur is <i>architectonik&eacute;</i> in the
highest sense; that power of execution which creates, forms, and
constitutes: not the profoundness of single thoughts, not the richness
of imagery, not the abundance of illustration." Assuredly, no "new
definition" can be an <a name="page208" id="page208">effective</a> one
which conflicts with Goethe's incontrovertible dictum.</p>

<p>But this much having been admitted, I am only too willing to protest
against the uncritical outcry against Browning's musical incapacity.</p>

<p>A deficiency is not incapacity, otherwise Coleridge, at his highest the
most perfect of our poets, would be lowly estimated.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Bid shine what would, dismiss into the shade<br />

</div>

<p>Browning's music is oftener harmonic than melodic: and musicians know
how the general ear, charmed with immediately appellant melodies,
resents, wearies of, or is deaf to the harmonies of a more remote, a
more complex, and above all a more novel creative method. He is, among
poets, what Wagner is among musicians; as Shakspere may be likened to
Beethoven, or Shelley to Chopin. The common assertion as to his
incapacity for metric music is on the level of those affirmations as to
his not being widely accepted of the people, when the people have the
chance; or as to the indifference of the public to poetry generally--and
this in an age when poetry has never been so widely understood, loved,
and valued, and wherein it is yearly growing more acceptable and more
potent!</p>

<p>A great writer is to be adjudged by his triumphs, not by his failures:
as, to take up Montaigne's simile again, a famous race-horse is
remembered for its successes and not for the races which it lost. The
tendency with certain critics is to reverse the process. Instead of
saying with <a name="page209" id="page209">the</a> archbishop in Horne's
"Gregory VII.," "He owes it all to his Memnonian voice! He has no genius:"
or of declaring, as Prospero says of Caliban in "The Tempest," "He is as
disproportioned in his manners as in his shape:" how much better to affirm
of him what Ben Jonson wrote of Shakspere, "Hee redeemed his vices with
his vertues: there was ever more in him to bee praysed than to bee
pardoned." In the balance of triumphs and failures, however, is to be
sought the relative measure of genius--whose equipoise should be the
first matter of ascertainment in comparative criticism.</p>

<p>For those who would discriminate between what Mr. Traill succinctly
terms his <i>generic</i> greatness as thinker and man of letters, and his
<i>specific</i> power as poet, it is necessary to disabuse the mind of
Browning's "message." The question is not one of weighty message, but of
artistic presentation. To praise a poem because of its optimism is like
commending a peach because it loves the sunshine, rather than because of
its distinguishing bloom and savour. The primary concern of the artist
must be with his vehicle of expression. In the instance of a poet, this
vehicle is language emotioned to the white-heat of rhythmic music by
impassioned thought or sensation. Schopenhauer declares it is all a
question of style now with poetry; that everything has been sung, that
everything has been duly cursed, that there is nothing left for poetry
but to be the glowing forge of words. He forgets that in quintessential
art there is nothing of the past, nothing old: even the future has part
therein only in that the present is always encroaching upon, becoming,
the future. The famous pessimistic philosopher has, in common with other
critics, made, in <a name="page210" id="page210">effect</a>, the same
remark--that Style exhales the odour of the soul: yet he himself has
indicated that the strength of Shakspere lay in the fact that 'he had no
taste,' that 'he was not a man of letters.' Whenever genius has displayed
epic force it has established a new order. In the general disintegration
and reconstruction of literary ideals thus involved, it is easier to be
confused by the novel flashing of strange lights than to discern the
central vivifying altar-flame. It may prove that what seem to us the
regrettable accidents of Browning's genius are no malfortunate flaws,
but as germane thereto as his Herculean ruggednesses are to Shakspere,
as the laboured inversions of his blank verse are to Milton, as his
austere concision is to Dante. Meanwhile, to the more exigent among us
at any rate, the flaws seem flaws, and in nowise essential.</p>

<p>But when we find weighty message and noble utterance in union, as we do
in the magnificent remainder after even the severest ablation of the
poor and mediocre portion of Browning's life-work, how beneficent seem
the generous gods! Of this remainder most aptly may be quoted these
lines from "The Ring and the Book,"</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Gold as it was, is, shall be evermore;<br />
      Prime nature with an added artistry."</p>
</div>

<p>How gladly, in this dubious hour--when, as an eminent writer has phrased
it, a colossal Hand, which some call the hand of Destiny and others that
of Humanity, is putting out the lights of Heaven one by one, like
candles after a feast--how gladly we listen to this poet with his serene
faith in God, and immortal life, and the soul's unending development!
"Hope hard in the <a name="page211" id="page211">subtle</a> thing that's
Spirit," he cries in the Prologue to "Pacchiarotto": and this, in manifold
phrasing, is his <i>leit-motif</i>, his fundamental idea, in unbroken line
from the "Pauline" of his twenty-first to the "Asolando" of his
seventy-sixth year. This superb phalanx of faith--what shall prevail
against it?</p>

<p>How winsome it is, moreover: this, and the humanity of his song.
Profoundly he realised that there is no more significant study than the
human heart. "The development of a soul: little else is worth study," he
wrote in his preface to "Sordello": so in his old age, in his last
"Reverie"--</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"As the record from youth to age<br />
     <span class="in1">Of my own, the single soul--</span><br />
      So the world's wide book: one page<br />
     <span class="in1">Deciphered explains the whole</span><br />
      Of our common heritage."</p>
</div>

<p>He had faith also that "the record from youth to age" of his own soul
would outlast any present indifference or neglect--that whatever tide
might bear him away from our regard for a time would ere long flow
again. The reaction must come: it is, indeed, already at hand. But one
almost fancies one can hear the gathering of the remote waters once
more. We may, with Strafford,</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in11">"feel sure</span><br />
      That Time, who in the twilight comes to mend<br />
      All the fantastic day's caprice, consign<br />
      To the low ground once more the ignoble Term,<br />
      And raise the Genius on his orb again,--<br />
      That Time will do me right." . . .</p>
</div>

<p>Indeed, Browning has the grand manner, for all it is
<a name="page212" id="page212">more</a> that of the
Scandinavian Jarl than of the Italian count or Spanish grandee.</p>

<p>And ever, below all the stress and failure, below all the triumph of his
toil, is the beauty of his dream. It was "a surpassing Spirit" that went
from out our midst.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"One who never turned his back but marched breast forward,<br />
     <span class="in3">Never doubted clouds would break,</span><br />
      Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph,<br />
      Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,<br />
     <span class="in6">Sleep to wake."</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">"Speed, fight on, fare ever There as here!" are the
last words of this brave soul. In truth, "the air seems bright with his
past presence yet."</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Sun-treader--life and light be thine for ever;<br />
      Thou art gone from us--years go by--and spring<br />
      Gladdens, and the young earth is beautiful,<br />
      Yet thy songs come not--other bards arise,<br />
      But none like thee--they stand--thy majesties,<br />
      Like mighty works which tell some Spirit there<br />
      Hath sat regardless of neglect and scorn,<br />
      Till, its long task completed, it hath risen<br />
      And left us, never to return."</p>

<p class="title">MODERN PAINTING,</p>

<p class="center">By GEORGE MOORE.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center"><i>SOME PRESS NOTICES</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">"Of the very few hooks on art that painters and critics should on no
account leave unread this is surely one."--<i>The Studio</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">"His book is one of the best books about pictures that have come
into our hands for some years."--<i>St. James's Gazette</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">"If there is an art critic who knows exactly what he means and says
it with exemplary lucidity, it is 'G.M.'"--<i>The Sketch</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">"A more original, a better informed, a more suggestive, and let us
add, a more amusing work on the art of to-day, we have never read
than this volume."--<i>Glasgow Herald</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">"Impressionism, to use that word, in the absence of any fitter
one,--the impressionism which makes his own writing on art in this
volume so effective, is, in short, the secret both of his likes and
dislikes, his hatred of what he thinks conventional and mechanic,
together with his very alert and careful evaluation of what comes home
to him as straightforward, whether in Reynolds, or Rubens, or Ruysdael,
in Japan, in Paris, or in modern England."--Mr. Pater in <i>The
Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">"As an art critic Mr. George Moore certainly has some signal
advantages. He is never dull, he is frankly personal, he is untroubled
by tradition."--<i>Westminster Gazette</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">"Mr. Moore, in spite of the impediments that he puts in the way of
his own effectiveness, is one of the most competent writers on painting
that we have."--<i>Manchester Guardian</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">"His [Mr. Moore's] book is one that cannot fail to be much talked
about; and everyone who is interested in modern painting will do well
to make acquaintance with its views."--<i>Scottish Leader</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">"As everybody knows by this time, Mr. Moore is a person of strong
opinions and strong dislikes, and has the gift of expressing both in
pungent language."--<i>The Times</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">"Of his [Mr. Moore's] sincerity, of his courage, and of his candour
there can be no doubt.... One of the most interesting writers on art
that we have."--<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>Grown-up folk to whom children are dear will, we think, find in the
chapters of <i>Barty's Star</i> not a little to attract them. In Barty his
parents noticed what they judged to be clear proofs of the child's
earlier existence in another world; and these signs form the foundation
of a book that certainly does not lack either grace or originality. The
love of the parents, the one for the other, is made a commanding feature
of the story.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
